The tire swing in the yard is the only thing that makes it look\\nlike a kid lives here. There were never any drawings in the house. None on\\nthe fridg e or walls. No children ’s books on the shelves. No shoes by the\\nfront door or floaties in the pool.\\nIt’s a couple’ s home. Not a family’ s.\\nI stare out the window , watching the tire sway back and forth in the\\nbreeze as it hangs from the oak, and absently rub the red ribbon in my hair\\nbetween my fingers, feeling the comfort of the smooth surface.\\nHe always had time to push her on the swing, didn’ t he? He had time for\\nher.\\nAnd she for him.\\nWalkie talkies shoot off beeps and white noise somewhere behind me\\nwhile footfalls hit the stairs and doors slam above me. The police and\\nparamedics are busy upstairs, but they’ll want to talk to me soon, I’m sure.\\nI swallow , but I don’ t blink.\\nI’d thought the tire swing was for me when he installed it ten years ago.\\nI was allowed to play on it, but my mother was the one who really loved it.\\nI used to watch  them out my bedroom window late at night, my father\\npushing her and the magic of their play and laughter making me want to be\\nin the middle of it. But I knew as soon as they saw me the magic would\\nchange. It would disappear .\\nSo, I stayed at my window and only ever watched.\\nLike I still do. I bite the corner of my mouth, watching a green leaf flutter past the\\nswing and land inside the tire where my mother sat countless times. The\\nimage of her white nightgown and light hair flowing through the night as\\nshe swung on it is still so vivid, because the last time was only yesterday .\\nA throat clears behind me, and I finally blink, dropping my eyes.\\n“Did they say anything to you?” Mirai asks me with tears in her voice.\\nI don’ t turn around, but after a moment, I give a slow shake of my head.\\n“When did you last speak to them?”\\nI can’ t answer that. I’m not sure.\\nBehind me, I feel her approach, but she stops several feet back as the\\nclank of the first ambulance gurney jostles and creaks down the stairs and is\\ncarried from the house.\\nI tip my chin up, steeling myself at the distant commotion outsid e as the\\nparamedics open the front door. The calls and questions, the horns honking\\nas more people arrive, beyond the gates, where the media can no doubt see\\nthe body being wheeled out.\\nWhen did I last speak to my par ents?\\n“The police found some medications in your parents’ bathroom,” Mirai\\nbroaches in her soft voice. “The y have your father ’s name on them, so they\\ncalled the doctor and learned that he had cancer , Tiernan.”\\nI don’ t move.\\n“They never said anything to me,” she tells me. “Did you know your\\nfather was sick?”\\nI shake my head again, still watching the tire sway .\\nI hear her swallo w. “Apparently , he tried treatments, but the disease was\\naggressive,” she says. “The doctor said he… he wasn’ t going  to last the\\nyear, honey .”\\nA gust of wind picks up outside, churning the swing, and I watch the\\nrope spin the tire as it twists.\\n“It looks like… It looks like they…” Mirai trails of f, unable to finish her\\nthought.\\nI know what it looks like. I knew when I found them this morning.\\nToulouse, my mother ’s Scottish terrier , was clawing at the door and begging\\nto get into their bedroom, so I cracked it open. The thought occurred to me\\nthat it was weird they weren’ t up yet, but I let the dog in anyway . Just\\nbefore I closed it again though, my eyes shot up, and I saw them.\\nOn the bed. In each other ’s arms. Fully dressed. He wore his favorite Givenchy suit and she was in the Oscar de la Renta\\ngown she wore to the Cannes Film Festival in 2013.\\nHe had cancer .\\nHe was dying.\\nThey knew , and my mother had decided not to let him leave without her .\\nShe decided that there was nothing else without him.\\nNothing else.\\nA sting hits the backs of my eyes, but it’ s gone almost immediately .\\n“The police haven’ t found a note,” Mirai says. “Did you find—”\\nBut I turn my head, meeting her eyes, and she instantly falls silent.\\nWhat a stupid question.\\nI lock my jaw, swallowing the needles in my throat. Over all the years\\nof nannies and boarding schools and summer camps where I was kept busy\\nand raise d by anyone but them, I’d found little pain in anything  my parents\\ndid anymore. But it seems there are still parts of me to hurt.\\nThey didn’t leave me a note. Even now, there was nothing they wanted\\nto say to me.\\nI blink away the tears and turn back around, trying to stare hard at the\\nswing again as it twists and glides back and forth in the wind.\\nI hear Mirai sniffle and sob quietly behind me, because she knows. She\\nknows what I’m feeling, because she’ s been here since the beginning.\\nAfter another minute I see her outside the window , walking past me,\\nand I hadn’ t even realized she’d left the room.\\nShe carries shears in her hand and charges right up to the tire swing, and\\nas she raises the scissors to the rope, I clench my fists under my arms and\\nwatch her press the handles together , working through the rope until the tire\\nhangs by twine and eventually falls to the ground.\\nA single tear finally falls, and for the first time since I’ve been home all\\nsummer , I feel something like love.\\n \\n \\nHours later, the sun has set, the house is quiet again, and I’m alone. Almost\\nalone. Reporters are still lingering beyond the gates.\\nMirai wanted me to come home  with her to the small, one bedroom she\\nwas certainly paid more than enough not to have to live in. But since she\\nhad always been here night and day and traveling wherever my mother went, it made more sense not to keep an apartment at all, much  less rent a\\nbigger one. I politely declined.\\nShe took Toulouse, since that dog gets along with me about as well as\\nhe would a wet cat, and said she’d be back first thing in the morning.\\nI should ’ve been nicer to her. When she offered to stay here instead, I\\njust wanted everyone gone. The noise and attention made me nervous, and I\\ndon’t want to hear all the phone calls Mirai has to make tonight , which will\\njust be a reminder of how all hell is breaking loose out in the world and on\\nsocial media.\\nThey’re saying things about my parents.\\nThey’re speculating about me, no doubt.\\nThe pity. The predictions of when I’ll follow my mom and dad, either\\nby overdose or my own suicide. Everyone has an opinion and thinks they\\nknow everything. If I thought I lived in a fish bowl before…\\nI walk back to the stove, letting out a breath. My parents left me to deal\\nwith this shit.\\nSteam rises from the pot, and I turn off the burner and pour the ramen\\ninto a bowl. I rub my dry lips together and stare at the yellow broth as my\\nstomach growls. I haven’ t eaten or drank anything all day, but I’m not sure I\\nhad any intention of eating this when I finally wandered into the kitchen\\ntonight to make it. I just alway s liked the process of cooking things. The\\nrecipe, the procedure… I know what to do. It’ s meditative.\\nI wrap my hand s around the bowl, savoring the heat coursing through\\nthe ceramic and up my arms. Chills break out over my body , and I almost\\nswallow , but then I realize it’ll take more ener gy than I have.\\nThey’re dead, and I haven’ t cried. I’m just more worried about\\ntomorrow and handling everything.\\nI don’t know what to do, and the idea of forcing small talk with studio\\nexecutives or old friends of my parents over the weeks to come as I bury\\nmy mother and father and deal with everything I’ve inherited makes the bile\\nrise in my throat. I feel sick. I can’ t do it.\\nI can’ t do it.\\nThey knew I didn’t have the skills to deal with situations like this. I\\ncan’t smile or fake things I’m not feeling.\\nDigging chopsti cks out of the drawer , I stick them in the bowl and pick\\nit up, carrying it upstairs. I reach the top and don’t pause as I turn away\\nfrom their bedroom door and head left, toward my own room. Carrying the bowl to my desk, I pause, the smell of the ramen making\\nmy stomach roll. I set it down and move to the wall, sliding down until I’m\\nsitting on the floor . The cool hardwood eases my nerves, and I’m tempted to\\nlie down and rest my face on it.\\nIs it weird I stayed in the house tonight when they died just down the\\nhall this morning? The coroner estimated the time of death about two a.m. I\\ndidn’ t wake up until six.\\nMy mind races, caught between wanting to let it go and wanting to\\nprocess how everything happened. Mirai is here every day. If I didn’ t find\\nthem, she would ’ve. Why didn’ t they wait until I’d gone back to school\\nnext week? Did they even remember I was in the house?\\nI let my head fall back against the wall and lay my arms over my bent\\nknees, closing my burning eyes.\\nThey didn’ t leave me a note.\\nThey dressed up. They put the dog out. They scheduled Mirai to come\\nlate this morning, instead of early .\\nThey didn’ t write me a note.\\nTheir closed door looms ahead  of me, and I open my eyes,  staring\\nacross my bedroom, through my open door, down the long hallway , and to\\ntheir room at the other end of the hall.\\nThe house sounds the same.\\nNothing has changed.\\nBut just then, a small buzz whirs from somewhere, and I blink at the\\nfaint sound, dread bringing me back to reality . What is that?\\nI thought I turned off my phone.\\nReporters know to field requests for comment through my parents’\\nrepresentatives, but that doesn’ t stop the greedy ones—of which most are—\\nfrom digging up my personal cell number .\\nI reach up, pawing for my phone on my desk, but when I press the\\nPower  button I see that it’ s still of f.\\nThe buzzing continues, and just as realization dawns, my heart  skips a\\nbeat.\\nMy private cell. The one buried in my drawer .\\nOnly my parents and Mirai had that number . It was a phone for them to\\nreach me if anything was urgent, since they knew I turned off my other one\\na lot.\\nThey never used that number though, so I never kept it on me anymore. Pushing up on my knees, I reach into my desk drawer and pull the old\\niPhone of f its char ger and fall back to the floor , looking at the screen.\\nColorado. I don’ t know anyone in Colorado.\\nThis phone never gets calls though. It could be a reporter who somehow\\ntracked down the phone, but then it’s not registered under my name, so I\\ndoubt it.\\nI answer it. “Hello?”\\n“Tiernan?”\\nThe man’ s voice is deep, but there’ s a lilt of surprise in it like he didn’ t\\nexpect me to answer .\\nOr he’ s nervous.\\n“It’s Jake V an der Ber g,” he says.\\nJake V an der Ber g…\\n“Your Uncle  Jake V an der Ber g.”\\nAnd then I remember . “My father ’s…?”\\n“Brother ,” he finishes for me. “Step-brother , actually , yes.”\\nI compl etely forgot. Jake Van der Berg had rarely been mentioned in\\nthis house. I didn’ t grow up with any relatives, so I’d completely blanked\\non the fact that I had one.\\nMy mother grew up in foster care, never knew her father , and had no\\nsiblings. My dad only had an estranged, younger step-brother I’d never met.\\nI had no aunts, uncles, or cousins growing up, and my father ’s parents were\\ndead, so I didn’ t have grandparents, either .\\nThere’ s only one reason he’ s calling me after seventeen years.\\n“Um,” I mumble, searching for words. “My mother ’s assistant will be\\nhandling the funeral arrangeme nts. If you need the details, I don’t have\\nthem. I’ll give you her number .”\\n“I’m not coming to the funeral.”\\nI still for a moment. His voice is on edge.\\nAnd he hasn’ t offered condolences for “my loss,” which is unusual. Not\\nthat I need them, but why is he calling, then? Does he think my father wrote\\nhim into his will?\\nHonestly , he might have. I have no idea.\\nBut before I can ask him what he wants, he clears his throat. “Your\\nfather ’s attorney called me earlier , Tiernan,” he tells me. “Since I’m your\\nonly living relative, and you’re still underage, your parents apparently left\\nyou in my care.” In his care?\\nAppar ently . Sounds like this is news to him, too.\\nI don’ t need anyone’ s care.\\nHe continues, “You’ll be eighteen in a couple months, though. I’m not\\ngoing to force you to do anything, so don’ t worry .”\\nOkay . I hesitate for a moment, not sure if I feel relieved or not. I didn’ t\\nhave time to process the remind er that I wasn’ t a legal adult, and what that\\nmeant now that my parents were gone, before he assured me that it\\nwouldn’ t mean anything. My life won’ t change.\\nFine.\\n“I’m sure, grow ing up in that life,” he says, “you’re a hell of a lot more\\nworld-wise than we are and can take pretty good care of yourself by now\\nanyway .”\\n“We?” I murmur .\\n“My sons and I,” he says. “Noah and Kaleb. They’re not much older\\nthan you, actually . Maybe a few years.”\\nSo, I have cousins. Or… step-cousins.\\nWhatever . It’s basically nothing. I play with the light blue threa d on my\\nsleep shorts.\\n“I just wanted to reach out to tell you that,” he finally says. “If you want\\nto emancipate yourself, you’ll get no argument from me. I have no interest\\nin making anything harder for you by uprooting you from your life.”\\nI stare at the thread, pinching it between my nails as I pull it tight. Okay ,\\nthen.\\n“Well… thank you for calling.”\\nAnd I start to pull the phone away from my ear, but then I hear his voice\\nagain. “Do you want  to come here?”\\nI bring the phone back to my ear .\\n“I didn’ t mean to sound like you weren’ t welcome,” he says. “You are. I\\njust thought…”\\nHe trails of f, and I listen.\\nHe chuckles. “It’s just that we live a pretty secluded life here, Tiernan,”\\nhe explains. “It’s not much fun for a young woman, especially one who has\\nno idea who the hell I am, you know?” His tone turns solemn. “Your dad\\nand I, we just…we never saw eye to eye.”\\nI sit there, sayin g nothing. I know it would be polite to talk to him. Or\\nmaybe he expects me to ask questions. Like what happened between him and my father? Did he know my mother?\\nBut I don’ t want to talk. I don’ t care.\\n“Did he tell you we lived in Colorado?” Jake asks softly . “Close to\\nTelluride but up in the mountains.”\\nI draw in a breath and release it, winding the thread around my finger .\\n“It’s not a far ride to town in nice weather , but we get snowe d in for\\nmonths at a time during the winter ,” he goes on. “Very different from your\\nlife.”\\nI raise my eyes, letting them slowly drift around the barren room I’ve\\nbarely ever slept in. Shelves filled with books I never finished  reading. A\\ndesk piled with pretty journals I liked buying but hardly wrote in. I thought\\nabout decorating in here during breaks at home, but as with everything else,\\nthe wallpaper was never purchas ed, because I could never decid e. I have no\\nimagination.\\nYeah, my life…\\nThe weight of my parents’ door looms ahead of me, down the hall.\\nSnowed in , he said.  For months at a time.\\n“No cable. No noise. No WiFi sometimes,” he says. “Just the sounds of\\nthe wind and the falls and the thunder .”\\nMy heart aches a little, and I don’t know if it’s his words or his voice.\\nJust the sounds of the wind and the falls and the thunder .\\nSounds amazing, actually . All of it sounds kind of nice. No one can get\\nto you.\\n“My boys are used to the seclusion,” he tells me. “But you…”\\nI pick up the thread again and twist it around my finger . But me…?\\n“I came out here when I wasn’ t much older than you,” he muses, and I\\ncan hear the smile in his voice. “I had soft hands and a head full of shit I\\ndidn’ t know what to do with. I was barely alive.”\\nNeedles prick my throat, and I close my eyes.\\n“There’ s something to be said for sweat and sun.” He sighs. “Hard\\nwork, solace, and keeping busy. We’ve built everything we have  here. It’s a\\ngood life.”\\nMaybe that’s what I need. To run away like he did at my age. Dive into\\nanything dif ferent, because the only thing I feel anymore is tired.\\n“Have you had a good life?” he nearly whispers.\\nI keep my eyes closed, but I feel like I have a truck sitting on my lungs.\\nI’ve had a great life. I have a closet full of all the designer clothes and bags everyone expects a famous star’s daughter to own. I’ve been to two dozen\\ncountries, and I can buy anythi ng I want. My home is huge. My fridge is\\nstocked. How many people would happily trade places with me? How lucky\\nam I?\\n“Do you want to come here, T iernan?” he asks again.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI pull off my wireless headpho nes and let them rest around my neck as I\\ntake a look around the room. Their baggage claim area only has two\\ncarousels. It’ s like a bathroom at LAX.\\nIs he here? I spin around, trying to recognize someone I’ve never met,\\nbut he’ll probably know me before I know him anyway . Our family’ s\\npictures are hard to avoid online right now .\\nFollowing the crowd, I head to the second conveyor belt and wait for\\nthe luggage to be dropped. I probably brought way too much, especially\\nsince there’ s a good chance I won’ t stay long, but honestly , I wasn’ t\\nthinking. He emailed a ticket—told me I could use it or not—and I just\\ngrabbed my suitcases and started loading. I was too relieved to have\\nsomething to do.\\nI check my phone to make sure I didn’ t miss a call from him saying\\nwhere to meet, and I see a text from Mirai, instead.\\n \\nJust giving you a heads up… The coroner will conﬁrm the cause of death by the\\nend of the week. It will make the news. If you need to talk, I’m here. Always.\\n \\nI inhale a deep breath, but I forget to let it go as I slip my phone in my\\nback pocket. Cause of death.  We know how they died. All the religious\\nnutcases on Twitter are presently condemning my parents as sinners for\\ntaking their own lives, and I couldn’ t look at it. While I could say whatever I wanted  about my problems with Hannes and Amelia de Haas, I didn’ t\\nwant to hear bullshit from strangers who didn’ t know them.\\nI should turn of f my phone. I should...\\nI pinch my eyebrows together . I should go home .\\nI don’ t know this guy , and I don’ t like the people I do know .\\nBut last night, nothing sounded better than getting out of there.\\nThe carousel starts to spin, snapping me out of my head, and I watch as\\nthe bags start appearing. One of my black suitcases moves towa rd me, and I\\nreach down to grab it, but another hand suddenly appears, liftin g it for me,\\ninstead. I shoot up, coming face to face with a man.\\nWell, not face to face exactly . He stares down at me, and I open my\\nmouth to speak, but I can’t remember…anything. His eyes are almost\\nfrozen, and he doesn’ t blink as we stand there, locked.\\nIs this him?\\nI know my father ’s step-brother  is of Dutch descent, same as my dad,\\nand this guy’s certainly got the whole six-foot-two, athletic look with short-\\ncropped, dark blond hair and blue eyes whose slight amusement betrays his\\nstern set jaw and intimidating presence.\\n“You’re Jake?” I ask.\\n“Hi.”\\nHi? His gaze doesn’ t leave me, and for a moment I can’t pull away ,\\neither . I knew he and my father weren’ t blood, but for some reason, I\\nthought they’d look similar . I don’ t know why .\\nMy expectation was completely off, though, and it didn’ t occur to me\\nthat there was an age difference between them. Jake has to be at least ten\\nyears younger than Hannes. Late thirties, maybe early forties?\\nPerhaps that had something to do with them not getting along. In two\\ntotally dif ferent places, so not much in common growing up?\\nWe stand  there for a moment, and I feel like this is the point where most\\npeople would hug or something, but I take a step back—and away from him\\n—just in case.\\nHe doesn’t come in for an embrace, though. Instead, his eyes flash to\\nthe side, and he gestures. “This one, too?”\\nHis voice is deep but soft, like he’s a little bit scared of me but not\\nscared of anything else. My heart speeds up.\\nWhat did he ask me?\\nOh, the luggage. I look over my shoulder , seeing my other black case trailing this way .\\nI nod once, waiting for it to come down the line to us.\\n“How did you know it was me?” I asked him, remembering how he just\\ngrabbed my suitcase without a word to confirm my identity .\\nBut he laughs to himself.\\nI close my eyes for a moment, remembering he’s probably seen pictures\\nof me somewhere, so it wasn’ t hard to figure out. “Right,” I murmur .\\n“Excuse me,” he says, reaching past me to grab the second case. I\\nstumble back a step, his body brushing into mine.\\nHe pulls it off the belt and adds, “And you’re the only one here with\\nLouis V uitton luggage, so...”\\nI shoot him a look, noticing the jeans with dirt-stained knees and the\\nseven-dollar gray T -shirt he wears. “Y ou know Louis?” I ask.\\n“More than I care to,” he replies  and then fixes me with a look.  “I grew\\nup in that life, too, remember?”\\nThat life. He says it as if labels and luxury  negate any substance. People\\nmay live dif ferent realities, but the truth is always the same.\\nI clear my throat, reaching out for one of the cases. “I can take\\nsomething.”\\n“It’s okay .” He shakes his head. “W e’re good.”\\nI carry my pack on my back and hold the handle of my carry-on, while\\nhe grips my two rolling suitcases.\\nI’m ready to move, but he’s looking down at me, something timid but\\nalso amazed in his eyes.\\n“What?” I ask.\\n“No, sorry ,” he says, shaking his head. “Y ou just look like your mother .”\\nI drop my eyes. It’s not the first time I’ve heard that, and it’s a\\ncompliment, to be sure. My mother was beautiful. Charismatic,\\nstatuesque…\\nIt just never makes me feel good, though. As if everyone sees her first.\\nGray eyes, blonde hair, although mine is the natural sandy shade while\\nhers was colored to look more golden.\\nMy darker eyebrows are my own, though. A small source of pride. I like\\nhow they make my eyes pop.\\nHe inhales a deep breath. “Any more?” he asks, and I assume he’s\\ntalking about my luggage.\\nI shake my head. “Okay , let’s hit the road.”\\nHe leads the way toward the exit, and I follow closely behind , as we\\nmaneuver our way through the sparse crowd and outside.\\nAs soon as we step into the sun, I inhale the thick late-August air,\\nsmelling the blacktop and the trees lining the parking lot beyond. The\\nbreeze tickles the hair on my arms, and even though the sky is cloudless and\\neverything is green, I feel tempted to unwrap the jacket tied around my\\nwaist and put it on. We cross the walkway , barely needing to look for cars,\\nbecause traffic is worse in line for the valet at my parents’ count ry club on a\\nSunday afternoon. I like it. No horns or woofers shaking the pavement.\\nHe stops behind a black truck, but instead of popping down the tailgate,\\nhe just hauls my suitcase over the side and into the bed. Reaching back, he\\ntakes my other case and does the same.\\nI pick up my carry-on to help, but he quickly grabs that one, too, the\\ntight cords in his arm flexing and shining in the sun.\\n“I should’ve traveled lighter ,” I think out loud.\\nHe turns. “It’ s not just a visit.”\\nYeah, maybe. I’m still not sure, but I thought it was best to bring enough\\nfor the long haul if I decided to stay .\\nWe climb into the truck, and I put my seatbelt on as he starts the engine.\\nOn reflex, I reach for my headp hones around my neck. But I stop. It would\\nbe rude to tune him out, having just met him. My parents never took issue,\\nbut they asked me not to wear them around others.\\nI release the headphones and stare at the radio instead. Please let music\\nbe playing.\\nAnd as soon as the truck rumb les to life, the radio lights up, playing\\n“Kryptonite” loudly , and for a second, I’m relieved. Small talk hurts.\\nHe pulls out of the parking lot, and I clasp my hands on my lap, turning\\nmy head out the window .\\n“So, I checked into it,” he says over the radio. “We have an online high\\nschool that can take care of you.”\\nI turn my eyes on him.\\nHe explains, “We have a lot of kids here who are needed on the ranches\\nand such, so it’ s pretty common to homeschool or complete classes online.”\\nOh.\\nI relax a little. For a moment, I thought he expected me to attend school.\\nI had prepared myself for living  in a new place, but not getting accustomed to new teachers and classmates. I barely knew the ones I’d been with for the\\npast three years.\\nEither way , he needn’ t have bothered. I took care of it.\\n“I can stay at Brynmor ,” I tell him, turning my eyes back out the\\nwindow . “My school in Connecticut was happy to work with my…absence.\\nMy teachers have already emailed my syllabi, and I’ll be able to complete\\neverything online.”\\nThe highway starts to give way to the sporadic homes along the side of\\nthe road, some 80’s-style ranch es with rusty chain-link fences, bungalows,\\nand even  a Craftsman, all hugge d by the dark needles of the tall evergreens\\naround their yards.\\n“Good,” Jake says. “That’ s good. Let them know , though, that you can\\nbe offline for spells as the WiFi at my place is spotty and completely goes\\nout during storms. They might want to send your assignments in bulk, so\\nyou don’ t get behind during that downtime.”\\nI look over at him, seeing him glance away from the road to meet my\\neyes. I nod.\\n“But who know s…” he muses. “You might just be running for the hills\\nafter a week up at the cabin.”\\nBecause…?\\nHe cocks his head, joking, “No malls or caramel macchiatos close by .”\\nI turn my eyes back out my window, mumbling, “I don’t drink caramel\\nmacchiatos.”\\nIt’s reaso nable for him to anticip ate that maybe I won’ t feel comfortable\\nwith them or that I’ll miss my “life” back home, but suggesting I’m a prima\\ndonna who can’t live without a Starbucks is kind of dicky . I guess we can\\nthank TV for the rest of the world thinking California girls are all valley\\ntwits in tube tops, but with droughts, wildfires, earthquakes, mudslides, and\\none-fifth of the nation’ s serial killings happening on our turf, we’re tough,\\ntoo.\\nWe drive for a while, and thankfully , he doesn’ t talk more. The town\\nappears ahead, and I can make out carved wooden statues and a main street\\nof square buildings all attached to each other on both sides. People loiter on\\nthe sidewalks, talking to each other , while potted flowers hang from the\\nlight posts, givin g the place a quaint, cared-for vibe. Teenagers sit on their\\ntailgates where they’re parked on the curb, and I take in the businesses—\\neverything mom and pop and nothing chain. I look up, seein g the large hang ing banner right before we drive under\\nit.\\n \\nChapel Peak Smokin’ Summerfest!\\nAugust 26-29\\n \\nChapel Peak…\\n“This isn’ t Telluride,” I say , turning my eyes on him.\\n“I said it was outside of Telluride,” he corrects. “Wayyyy outside of\\nTelluride.”\\nEven better, actually . Telluride was a famous ski destination—lots of\\nshops and high-end fare. This will be dif ferent. I want dif ferent.\\nI watch the shops pass by. Grind House Café. Porter ’s Post Office. The\\nCheery Cherry Ice Cr eam Shop. The…\\nI turn my head to take in the cute red and white pin-striped awning as\\nwe pass a small shop and almost smile. “A candy store…”\\nI used to love candy stores. I haven’ t been inside one in years.\\nRebel’ s Pebbles, I read the sign . It sounds so wild west.\\n“Do you have your license?” he asks.\\nI turn my head back facing front and nod.\\n“Good.” He pauses, and I can feel him looking over at me. “Feel free to\\nuse any of the vehicles, just make sure I know where you’re going, okay?”\\nAny of the vehicles . Does he mean his and his sons’? Where are they, by\\nthe way?\\nNot that I expected them to be at the airport, too, but it kind of makes\\nme nervous that they might not be excited about me coming if they weren’ t\\nthere to greet me. Something else I’d failed to consider . They had a comfy ,\\ntestosterone-infused man-cave, and here comes the girl they think they’ll\\nhave to guard their dirty jokes around now .\\nOf course, it’ s Thursday . Maybe they’re just at work.\\nWhich reminds me…\\n“What do you do?” I ask him.\\nHe glances over at me. “My sons and I customize dirt bikes,”  he tells\\nme. “A TVs, dune buggies…”\\n“You have a shop here?”\\n“Huh?”\\nI clear my throat. “Y ou have a… a shop here?” I say again, louder . “No. We take orders, build them from our garage at home, and then ship\\noff the finished product,” he explains, and I can’t help but take another look\\nover at him. He fills up the driver ’s seat, the sun-kissed muscles in his\\nforearm tight as he holds the wheel.\\nSo different from my father , who hated being outside and never went\\nwithout a long-sleeved shirt, unless he was going to bed.\\nJake meets my eyes. “We’ll be getting a lot of orders in soon,” he says.\\n“It keeps  us pretty busy through out the winter , and then we send them off in\\nthe spring, just in time for the season to start.”\\nSo they worked from home. The three of them.\\nThey’ll be around all the time.\\nI absent ly rub my palms together as I stare ahead, hearing my pulse\\nquicken in my ears.\\nEven at Brynmo r my parents had arranged for me to have a single room\\nwith no roommate. I prefer being alone.\\nI wasn’t a hermit. I could talk to my teachers and have discussions, and\\nI love seeing the world and doing things, but I need space to breathe. A\\nquiet place of my own to decom press, and men are noisy . Espec ially young\\nones. W e’ll all be on top of each other all the time if they work from home.\\nI close my eyes for a moment, suddenly regretting doing this. Why did I\\ndo this?\\nMy classmates hated me, because they took my silence for\\nsnobbishness.\\nBut it’ s not that. I just need time. That’ s all.\\nUnfortunately , not many are patient enough to give me a chance. These\\nguys are going to see me as rude, just like the girls at school do. Why would\\nI purposely put myself in a situation to be forced to get to know new\\npeople?\\nI clench  my jaw and swallow , seeing him out of the corner of my eye.\\nHe’s staring at me. How long has he been watching me?\\nI instant ly force my face to relax  and my breathing to slow, but before I\\ncan bury my face in my phon e to cover up my near panic attack, he’s\\nswerving the truck to the left and coming full circle, heading back in the\\ndirection we just came.\\nGreat. He’ s taking me back to the airport. I freaked him out already .\\nBut as he speeds back down the main street, and I grip the seatb elt strap\\nacross my chest to steady myself, I watch as he passes back through two lights and jerks the wheel to the left, sliding into a parking spot on the side\\nof the street.\\nMy body lurche s forward as he stops short, and before I have a chance\\nto consider what’ s going on, he kills the engine and hops out of the truck.\\nHuh…\\n“Come on,” he tells me, casting me a look before he slams the door\\nclosed.\\nI look out the front windshield and see Rebel’ s Pebbles  etched in gold\\non the black V ictorian-style sign.\\nHe brought us back to the candy shop.\\nKeeping my small travel purse hooked across my chest, I climb out of\\nthe truck and follow him up onto the sidewalk. He opens the door, the tinkle\\nof a little bell ringing, and ushers me inside before he follows me.\\nThe heady scent of chocolate and caramel hits me, and I immediately\\nstart salivating. I haven’ t eaten since the handful of blueberries I forced\\ndown this morning before my flight.\\n“Yo, Spencer!” Jake shouts.\\nI hear the clutte r of a pan from somewhere in the back, and something\\n—like an oven door—falls closed.\\n“Jake V an der Bong!” a man strolls out from behind a glass wall, wiping\\nhis hands as he heads toward us. “How the hell are you?”\\nVan Der Bong? I dart my eyes up to Jake.\\nHe grins  down at me. “Ignore him,” he says. “I never smoked. I mean, I\\ndon’t smoke anymore. That’ s old shit.” He smiles at the other guy. “The old\\nme. The evil me.”\\nThey both laugh  and shake hands, and I gaze at the man who just came\\nout. Looks about the same age as Jake, although a few inches shorter , and\\ndressed in a red and blue flannel shirt with unkept brown hair .\\n“Spence, this is my niece, T iernan,” Jake tells him.\\nMr. Spencer turns his eyes on me, finishes wiping off his hand, and\\nholds it out to me. “Niece, huh?” His gaze is curious. “Tierna n. That’ s a\\npretty name. How are you?”\\nI nod once, taking his hand.\\n“Let her have whatever she wants,” Jake tells him.\\n“No, that’ s okay .” I shake my head.\\nBut Jake cocks an eyebrow , warning me, “If you don’t fill up a bag,\\nhe’ll fill it up for you, and it’ll be black licorice and peppermint sticks.” I scrunc h up my nose on reflex . The other man snorts. Black  licorice\\ncan go to hell.\\nJake walks off, grabbing a plastic bag, and proceeds to start filling it\\nwith taf fy as I stand there, my pride keeping me planted in place. It’ s always\\nthe heaviest chip on my shoulder . I don’ t like giving people what they want.\\nBut then I smell the sugar and the salt, and the warm chocolate scent\\nfrom the stoves hits the back of my throat and goes straight to my head. I’d\\nlove a taste.\\n“Whatchya waitin’ for , de Haas?” I hear my uncle call out.\\nI blink.\\nHe caps the taffy jar and move s to the gummy worms as he tosses a\\nlook over at me. I stare back. Calling me by my last name seems like it\\nshould feel playful. W ith him, it’ s…brusque.\\nI let out a breath  and move toward the bags, taking one for myself. “I’ll\\npay for it,” I inform him.\\nHe doesn’ t look at me. “Whatever you want.”\\nOpening the bag, I instinctively pass the chocolates and veer toward the\\nless caloric gummy candies, loading in some peach rings, watermelon\\nwedges, and blue sharks. I toss in some jelly beans and Sour Patch Kids,\\nknowing I won’ t eat any of this.\\nAbsently drifting to the next cannister , I dig in the scoop and pull out a\\nlittle pile of red.\\nSwedish Fish are filled with corn syrup, food dyes, and additives , my\\nmother once said. I look down at the candy , once loving the way they felt\\nbetween my teeth but hadn’ t tasted since I was thirteen. Back when I started\\nbeing willing to give up anythin g to make her value me. Maybe if I ate like\\nher, wore my make-up like her, bought Prada and Chanel purses like her,\\nand wore any garish monstrosity V ersace designed, she’d…\\nBut I shake my head, not finish ing the thought. I load in two heaping\\nscoops of the candy into my bag. Jake appears next to me, digging his hand\\nright into the jar. “These are my favorite, too,” he says and pops two into\\nhis mouth.\\n“Yo, dirtbag!” I hear Spencer shout.\\nBut Jake just laughs. I look back down, recapping the jar and twisting\\nmy bag shut.\\n“The bag is seven-ninety-five no matter what, so fill it up,” Jake tells\\nme and moves around me, down the line of candy containers. Seven ninety-five. Almost as expensive as the bottles of Swiss water my\\nmother bathed in. How did he end up so dif ferent than them?\\nI trailed down the two aisles, passing the chocolate confection case and\\nmy mouth watering a little at how good I knew everything tasted.\\n“Ready?” Jake walks past me.\\nI follow  him to the register , and I toss my bag on the counte r, afraid\\nhe’ll try to go first and pay for me.\\nI immediately take out my money, and the man, Spencer , seems to\\nunderstand, because he rings me up with no more than a moment’ s\\nhesitation.\\nI pay and back away , making room for Jake.\\nHe rings Jake up but looks at me. “Staying up… on the peak long?” he\\nasks, sounding hesitant all of a sudden.\\nThe peak?\\nBut Jake answers for me. “Y eah, possibly until next summer .”\\nThe man’ s eyes instantly flash to Jake, a look of apprehension crossing\\nhis face.\\n“Don’ t worry .” Jake laughs, handing the guy cash. “We’ll protect her\\nfrom the big, bad elements.”\\n“When have you ever been able to control Kaleb?” Spence shoo ts back,\\nsnatching the money from Jake.\\nKaleb. One of his sons. I look at Jake, but he just meets my eyes and\\nshakes his head, brushing it of f.\\nJake takes his change and his candy , and we start to leave.\\n“Thank you,” I tell Spencer .\\nHe just nods and watches us as we leave, making me feel more\\nunnerved than when I came in.\\nWe climb back into the truck, and my uncle pulls out, heading back in\\nthe direction we were originally going.\\nThe petals of the pink petunias flutter in the wind against the blue sky as\\nthey hang in their pots, and young men in sleeveless tees haul sacks of\\nsomething off the loading dock of the feed store and into their pickup. I’ll\\nbet everyone knows each other ’s names here.\\n“It’s not Telluride,” Jake offers, “but it’s as big of a town as I ever want\\nto see again.”\\nI agree. At least for a while. We head  past the last of the businesses, over some tracks, and start to\\nwind up a paved road dense with evergreen trees, slowly climbing in\\nelevation.\\nThe highway narrows, and I look through the windshield, seeing the\\ntrees getting taller and cutting off more and more of the late afternoon light\\nas we travel deeper , leaving the town behind. A few gravel and dirt roads\\nsprout off the main lane, and I try to peer down the dark paths, but I can’t\\nsee anything. Do they lead to other properties? Homes?\\nWe climb for a while, the engine whirring as Jake weaves and curves\\naround every bend and I can no longer see anything of the town below .\\nRays of sun glimmer through the branches, and I blink my eyes against it,\\nfeeling the truck pull off the paved highway and onto a dirt road as I sway\\nin my seat with the bumps.\\nI hold the dash with one hand, watching the lane ahead lined with firs.\\nWe climb for another twenty minutes.\\n“It’s quite a drive,” he tells me as the sky grows more dim, “so if you\\nwant to go to town, make sure me or one of my sons are with you, okay?”\\nI nod.\\n“I don’t want you to get caught  on this road after dark by yourself,” he\\nadds.\\nYeah, me neither . He wasn’ t kidding when he said ‘secluded’. You\\nbetter have what you need, because it’s not a quick trip to the store if you\\nneed milk, sugar , or cough syrup.\\nHe turns right and pulls up a steep gravel driveway , the rocks crunching\\nunder the tires as I start to see structures coming into view again. Lights\\nshine through the trees, easy to see, since it’ s just about dark.\\n“All of that road we just traveled gets buried in winter ,” he informs me,\\nand I see him looking over at me, “and with some terrain steep and icy, it\\nmakes it imposs ible to make it to town for months with the roads closed.\\nWe’ll take you to the candy store to load up before the snow starts.”\\nI ignore  the joke and peer out the window , trying to see the buildings\\nwe’re approachi ng through the last remnants of sunlight, but with the trees\\neverywhere, I can’t see much. Something that looks like a stable, a couple\\nof sheds, a few other smaller structures buried in the thick, and then…\\nHe pulls the truck up onto even land finally and parks right in front of a\\nhouse with massive windows and a few lights on inside. I shoot my eyes\\nleft, right, up, and down, taking in the huge place, and even though I can’t make out any details in the dark, it’s big, and there’ s three floors, as well as\\nupper and lower sprawling decks.\\nA twinge of relief hits me. When  he said cabin, I immediately registered\\n“doomsday prepper with the barest essentials to survive,” thinking more of\\nthe solitude and space away from L.A., than the potential hovel I might’ve\\njust agreed to live in. It wasn’ t until I got here that I started worrying about\\nmy rash decision and what I had actually signed up for. I didn’ t need the\\nInternet, but I was hoping for at minimum, indoor plumbing.\\nAnd—I gaze at the house, still sitting as he climbs out of the truck— I\\nthink we’r e in luck.\\nI only hesitate another moment before I open my door and slide out of\\nthe truck, taking my backpack with me. Maybe I overreacted. Maybe there\\nwasn’ t much to be nervous about. It’ s quiet like I hoped, and I inhale the air ,\\nthe fresh  scent of water and rock sending chills down my arms . I love that\\nsmell. It remind s me of hiking  Vernal Fall at Yosemite with my summer\\ncamp years ago.\\nHe carries my two suitcases, and even though it’s a little chilly , I keep\\nmy pullover tied around my waist and follow him up the wooden steps. The\\nfront of the house is almost all windows on the bottom floor , so I can kind\\nof see inside. The downstairs looks like one large great room with high\\nceilings, and even though there ’s a lot of one color—brown wood, brown\\nleather , brown antlers, and brow n rugs—I make out some stone  features, as\\nwell.\\n“Hello!” Jake calls out, entering the house and setting my suitcases\\ndown. “Noah!”\\nI follow him, gently shutting the door behind me.\\nTwo dogs rush up, a brown lab and another one, scrawny with gray and\\nblack hair and glassy black eyes. Jake leans over, giving them both a good\\npetting as he looks around the house.\\n“Anyone here?” he yells again.\\nI immediately look up, seeing a couple levels of rafters, altho ugh the\\nceiling drops to the left and also where the kitchen is to the right. There’ s\\nnot a lot of walls down here as the living room, dining room, sitting room,\\nand kitchen just all melt together , not leaving much privacy .\\nIt’s spacious, though.\\n“Yeah, I’m here!” a man’ s voice calls out. A young guy walks out of the kitchen fisting two beer bottles and\\nshakes his head at Jake. “Jesus Christ. Fuckin’ Shawnee got out again,” he\\nsays.\\nHe strolls up to us, looking like he’ s about to hand Jake one of the beers,\\nbut then he looks at me and stops.\\nHis dark blond hair is slicked back under a backward baseball cap, and\\nhe doesn’ t look much older than me, maybe twenty or twenty-one. His\\nbody , though… His strong arms are tanned dark under his green T-shirt, and\\nhe’s broad. His crystal clear blue eyes widen, and his mouth hooks in a half-\\nsmile.\\n“This is Noah,” Jake introduces us. “My youngest.”\\nIt takes me a moment, but I raise my hand to shake his. Instead of taking\\nit, though, he just puts one of the bottles in it and says, “Learn to like it. We\\ndrink a lot here.”\\nThe sweat from  the bottle coats my palm, and I shoot Jake a look. He\\ntakes it from me and looks to his son. “Y our brother?”\\n“Still in,” Noah replies, but he doesn’ t take his eyes of f me.\\n“Right.”\\nIn? I start to wonder what that means but shake it off, wiping my wet\\nhand on my jeans, still feeling his eyes on me. Why is he staring?\\nI meet his eyes again, and he quirks a real smile. Should I say\\nsomething? Or should he say something? I guess this is weird. We’re\\nessentially cousins. Am I supposed to hug him or something? Is it rude not\\nto?\\nWhatever .\\n“How long did you look for the horse before you gave up?” Jake asks\\nhim, a sigh that he won’ t let out thickening his voice.\\nNoah smiles brightly and shrugs. “My logic is that if we don’t find her\\nthen she won’ t ever run away again.”\\nJake cocks an eyebrow as he glances down at me and explai ns, “We\\nhave a young mare who always  seems to find some way out of her stall.”\\nAnd then he eyes his son again as if this is a tired subject. “But horses are\\nexpensive, so she needs to be found.”\\nThe kid holds up his beer and backs away . “Just came back for fuel.”\\nAnd then he locks eyes with me as he walks toward the back of the house.\\n“If you shower , save me some hot water ,” he tells me. I watch him walk past the large stone fireplace, down a long hallway ,\\nand eventually I hear a screen door slam shut somewhere at the back of the\\nhouse. He’ s going to find a horse tonight?\\n“It’s dark so I’ll show you around the property in the mornin g,” Jake\\nsays, walking of f to the right, “but here’ s the kitchen.”\\nHe trails around the island in the lar ge space, but I stay back.\\n“Of course, help yourself to anything,” he explains, meeting my eyes.\\n“We’ll be makin g plenty of runs to town before the weather starts in the\\nnext couple of months, so we can stock the pantry with any food you like.\\nWe’ll be doing some canning, too.” He closes the fridge door I’m guessing\\nhis son left open and informs me, “We try to grow , catch, and kill as much\\nof our own food as possible.”\\nIt makes sense why I thought I saw a barn and a greenhouse among the\\nother structures. With getting snowed in for such long periods of time, it’s\\nsmart to rely on grocery stores and the town as little as possible.\\nHe gestures for me to follow him, and I join him as he opens a door off\\nthe side of the kitchen.\\n“If you need the washer and dryer , it’s out here in the shop,” he tells me,\\nflipping on a light. He descends the few stairs, and I see another truck\\nparked in the bright garage, this one red.\\nJake picks up a wicker laundry basket off the cement floor and tosses it\\nback onto the top of the dryer , but as I take a step, something catches my\\neye, and I stop at the top of the stairs. A buck hangs by its hind legs off to\\nthe right, a small pool of blood gathered around the drain the dead deer\\nhangs over . His antlers hover a foot of f the floor , swaying just slightly .\\nWhat the fu…? I hang my mouth open, gaping at it.\\nAll of a sudden, Jake is standing  next to me on the stairs. “Like I said…\\ngrow , catch, and kill.” He sound s amused by whatever he sees on my face.\\n“You’re not a vegetarian, are you?”\\nHe’s gone before I have a chance to answer , and I back away from the\\ngarage, step into the house again, and close the door. I’m not a vegetarian,\\nbut it occurs to me I’ve never met my meat before it was meat.\\nI swallow a couple times to wet my dry mouth.\\n“Living room, bathroom, TV,” he points out as I follow him. “We don’t\\nhave cable, but we have lots of movies, and you can stream as long as the\\nInternet holds out.” I follow him around the great room, seeing rustic-looking leather sofas,\\na coffee table, and chairs. The fireplace is big enough to sit in, and the\\nchimney stretches up through the rafters. Wood and leather everywhere. It\\nsmells like Home Depot in here with a tinge of burnt bacon.\\n“Do you want the W iFi?” Jake asks me.\\nThe reminder that I can stay connected here makes me pause for a\\nmoment.\\nBut if I refuse it, he’ll wonder why . “Sure,” I answer .\\n“It’s under Cobra Kai.”\\nI shoot a look up at him. Cute.\\nSearching the available networks, I find Cobra Kai is the only one that\\npops up.\\n“Password?”\\nHe’s quiet for a moment and then says, “A man confronts you, he is the\\nenemy . An enemy deserves…”\\nI stop myself before I can shake my head and type in “No Mercy .” It\\nconnects within seconds.\\nJake comes to my side and glances down. When he sees I got the\\npassword correct, he nods, impressed. “Y ou can stay .”\\nHe stands close, and I draw in a breath and take a step away , looking\\naround the room for what’ s next. But he stays rooted in place, watching me,\\nand something crosses his eyes that he doesn’ t say. Like me, he’s probably\\nwondering what  the hell I’m doing here and what he’s going to do with me\\nfor a week, or a year , until I leave.\\n“Are you hungry?” he asks.\\n“Tired.”\\nHe nods  to himself as if just remembering my parents died two days\\nago, and I’d traveled across four states today . “Of course.”\\nBut I’m not thinking that at all. I just need to be alone now .\\nHe picks up my suitcases, and I follow him upstairs, the bannister\\nwrapping around  the square landing at the top. I stop for a moment and turn\\nin a circle, takin g in the seven or eight doors around all sides, getting turned\\naround easily in this new place.\\n“My room.” Jake points directly ahead of us to a deep brown wooden\\ndoor and then in quick succession around the landing as we pass other\\nrooms. “Bathroom, Noah’ s room, and here’ s yours.” He drops my luggage at a door in the corner of the landing, the dim\\nlight from the wrought iron chandelier above barely making it possible to\\nget the lay of the land up here, but I don’ t care right now .\\nBut then it occurs to me he only pointed out his, Noah’ s, and my rooms.\\n“You have another…son,” I say to him. “Did I take his bedroom?”\\nThere are more doors. I wasn’ t infringing on their space, right?\\nBut he just turns his head and jerks his chin off to the right. To the only\\ndoor on the back wall. The only door between me and the bathroom.\\n“Kaleb’ s room is on the third floor ,” he explains. “It’s the only room up\\nthere, so no need for a tour. It’s got a great view , though. Lots of air and\\nspace. He likes space.” He sighs, his words weighted with frustration as he\\nopens my bedroom door, both dogs rushing inside ahead of us. “Keep that\\nin mind when you meet him and don’ t take anything personally .”\\nI pause a moment, curious what he means, but people say the same\\nthing about me. I glance at his door again, guessing there were stairs behind\\nit, since  Jake said his room is on the third floor . Is Kaleb up there? His\\nbrother said he was “in.”\\nJake opens my door and carries  my cases in, and I follow , hearing the\\nclick of a lamp and see the glow of the bulb suddenly filling the room.\\nMy chest instantly warms, and I almost smile.\\nIt’s nice.\\nNot that I expected much, but it’s cozy and uncluttered, and I even have\\nmy own fireplace. There are double doors across the room, a bed, a dresser ,\\nand a cushioned chair , everything done in woodsy colors leavin g plenty of\\nroom to pace and spread out on the floor if I want to sit like I often do.\\nA yawn pulls at my mouth, and my eyes water a little.\\n“Towels are here,” Jake tells me from the hallway . “Let me know if you\\nneed anything.”\\nHe steps back into the room, filling up the doorway , and I stand in the\\nmiddle of the space.\\n“Is it okay?” he asks me.\\nI nod, murmuring, “It’ s nice.”\\nI feel him watch me, and my muscles tighten. “You don’t talk much, do\\nyou?”\\nI glance up at him.\\nHe quirks a smile. “W e’ll change that.”\\nGood luck. Jake grabs the door handle and starts to pull it closed.\\n“You hated my father .” I turn my eyes on him, stopping him. “Didn’ t\\nyou?”\\nHe straightens and stares at me.\\n“Won’t it be uncomfortable for you to have me here… Uncle Jake?”\\nIf he hated my dad, won’ t I remind him of him?\\nBut his eyes on me turn piercin g, and he says in an even tone, “I don’t\\nsee your father when I look at you, T iernan.”\\nI still, not sure what that means or if it should make me feel better .\\nYou look like your mother . He’d said at the airport that I looked like my\\nmother . Did he see her when he looked at me, then? Was that what he\\nmeant?\\nHis eyes darken, and I watch as he rubs his thumb across the inside of\\nhis hand before he balls it into a fist.\\nI’m rooted, my stomach falling a little.\\n“And you don’t have to call me uncle,” he says. “I’m not really anyway ,\\nright?”\\nBut before I can answer , he clicks his tongue to call the dogs, they\\nfollow him out, and he pulls the door closed, leaving me alone.\\nI stand there, still, but the nerve s under my skin fire. One phone call, a\\ncoach seat, and four states later, it finally occurs to me... I don’t know these\\npeople.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI yawn, the warm smell of fresh coffee drifting through my nostrils as I arch\\nmy back on the bed and stretch my body awake.\\nDamn. I slept like shit.\\nI reach over on the nightstand for my phone to see what time it is, but\\nmy hand doesn’ t land on anything, just falls through the empty space.\\nWhat?\\nAnd that’s when I notice it. The roughness of the new sheets. The whine\\nof the bed under my body . The pillow that’s not the feather one my neck is\\nused to.\\nI blink my eyes awake, seeing the faint, morning light stream across the\\nceiling from where it spills in through the glass double doors in my room.\\nNot my room, actually .\\nI push up on my elbows, my head swimming and my eyelids barely able\\nto stay open as I yawn again.\\nAnd it all hits me at once. What had happened. Where I am. How I ran\\naway , because I was rash and I wasn’ t thinking. The uncertainty  that twisted\\nmy stomach a little, because nothing is familiar .\\nThe way I don’ t like this and how I’d for gotten I don’ t like change.\\nThe way he looked at me last night.\\nI train my ears, hearing the creak of tree branches bending with the\\nbreeze outside and how that breeze is getting caught in the chimney as it\\nblows. No distant chatter coming from my father ’s office and the six flat\\nscreens he plays as he gets ready for his day. No entourage of stylists and\\nassistants runnin g up and down the stairs, getting my mother ready for hers,\\nbecause she never leaves the house unless she’ s in full hair and make-up.\\nNo phones going of f or landscapers with their mowers.\\nFor a moment, I’m homesick. Unbidden images drift through my head.\\nThem lying on cold, metal slabs right now. Being slid into cold lockers. My\\nfather ’s skin blue, and my moth er’s hair wet and make-up gone.  Everything\\nthey were—everything the world would recognize—now gone.\\nI hold there, frozen and waiting  for the burn in my eyes to come. The\\nsting of tears. The pain in my throat.\\nWanting the tears to come.\\nWishing they would come.\\nBut they don’t. And that worries me more than my parents ’ death.\\nThere’ s a name for people who lack remorse. People who can’t empathize.\\nPeople who demonstrate strong anti-social attitudes.\\nI’m not a sociopath. I mean, I cried during the Battle of Winterfell on\\nGame of Thrones.  But I don’t cry—not once—w hen both of my parents\\ndie?\\nAt least no one in this town will care about me or how I’m coping with\\ntheir deaths. The only person back home who’d understand is Mirai.\\nAnd then I blink, realization hitting. “Mirai…”\\nShit. I throw back the covers and climb out of bed, heading for the chest\\nof drawe rs where my phone is charging. I grab it, turn it on, and see a list of\\nmissed notifications—mostly calls from my mother ’s assistant.\\nIgnoring the voicemails, I dial Mirai, noticing it’s before six on the west\\ncoast as I hold the phone to my ear .\\nShe answers almost immediately .\\n“Mirai,” I say before she says anything.\\n“Tiernan, thank goodness.”\\nShe breathes hard, like she either ran to the phone or just woke up.\\n“Sorry , my ringer was of f,” I explain.\\n“You’re okay?”\\n“I’m fine.”\\nChills spread up my arms, so I flip open the top of my suitcase and pull\\nout my black sweatshirt, juggling the phone as I try to slip it over my head. “So…are you going to stay?” she asks after a pause. “You know you\\ndon’t have to. If the house isn’ t comfortable or you feel weird—”\\n“I’m okay ,” I tell her. “The house is nice, and he’s…” I trail off,\\nsearching for my next word. What is he? “Hospitable.”\\n“Hospitable,” she repeats, clearly suspicious.\\nI clear my throa t. “So how is the world?” I ask, changing the subject.\\n“Anything that needs me?”\\n“Just take care of yourself,” she says, and I don’t miss the way she cuts\\nme off. “I won’ t bug you again. Call me if you want—I want you to—but\\nI’ll stick to texts to check in from time to time. I just want you to forget\\nabout everything here for a while, okay? I got it handled.”\\nI look around the bedroom I slept in, thankful I have it to myself,\\nbecause at least I have one place here that’s mine where I can go to be\\nalone.\\nBut the thought of walking out of this room and confronting new people\\nmakes my stomach roll, and I…\\nJust book me a flight back home, Mirai. I want to tell her that.\\nBut I don’ t.\\nJake seems to be amenable to letting me be and not pushing too hard,\\nbut Noah is friendly . Too friendly .\\nAnd I’ve yet to meet Kaleb, so that’ s another new person coming.\\nI walk for the double doors, needing some air .\\nThe least of my worries should be what people are thinking or saying\\nabout my absence back home—and what they’re thinking and saying about\\nmy parents—but I can’t help it. I feel like far away and out of the loop is\\nsuddenly the last place I should be right now. Especially when I’ve\\nfoolishly hung my hat in the middle of nowhere, with some guy my father\\nhated, and on land that smells like horse shit and dead, rotting deer\\ncarcasses.\\nI pin the phone between my ear and shoulder as I throw open the doors.\\n“I should be there for…”\\nBut I trail off, the doors spreading wide and the view looming  in front\\nof me.\\nMy mouth drops open. Suddenly , I’m an inch tall.\\n“You should do what you need to do,” Mirai replies.\\nBut I barely register what she says. I stare ahead, absently stepp ing onto\\nmy lar ge wooden deck as I take in the expanse before me that I didn’ t notice in the dark the night before.\\nMy heart thumps against my chest.\\nSo that’s “the peak.” It didn’ t cross my mind that the town was named\\nso for a reason.\\nIn the distance, in perfect view  between the trees beyond my balcony ,\\nstands a mountain, its granite peak gray and foreboding, skirted  with green\\npines and topped  with white clouds that make the scene so beautiful I stop\\nbreathing for a moment.\\nHoly shit.\\nIt’s just there. A cathedral, sitting in front of a blue sky, and before I can\\nstop myself, I raise my hand, reaching out for it like I want to take it in my\\nfist, but all I can feel is the morning air breeze through my fingers.\\nI inhale, the smell of the earth and stone drifting through my nose even\\nfrom here, the memory of the dead animal smell from last night forgotten.\\nThe scent of water hangs in the air, fresh but musty where it soaks into the\\nsoil and rock, and I inhale again, closing my eyes.\\nThe hairs on my arms rise.\\nI need to leave now. I don’t want to get used to that smell, because it’ll\\nstop being special before long.\\n“If you want to be here for the funeral, then be here,” Mirai goes on as\\nif I still care about anything we were discussing. “If you don’t, I don’t think\\nanyone will question the only daughter of Hannes and Amelia  de Haas if\\nshe’s too distraught by the sudden death of both parents to attend the\\nfuneral.”\\nI open my eyes, part of me wanting to smile and part of me disappointed\\nin myself, because I know I won’ t leave. Not today , anyway . I raise my eyes\\nand look at the peak, not wanting to stop looking at that view yet.\\nI swallow , remembering Mirai. “Thanks,” I tell her. “I’ll take a few days\\nand think about what I’ll do.”\\nThe funeral wasn’t for four or five more days, at least. People from\\naround the world would need time to get to California, as well as all the\\narrangements that had to be made. I had time.\\n“I love you, T iernan,” she says.\\nI pause. She’ s the only one who says that to me.\\nAll the memori es come flooding back, except now I catch things I\\ndidn’ t catch before. All the times she—not my mother or father—called me at school to see\\nif I needed anything. All the presents under the tree I know she—not them\\n—bought for me and the birthda y cards she signed for them. All the R-rated\\nmovies she got me into that I couldn’ t otherwise, and all the travel books\\nshe’d leave in my bag, because she knew they were my favorite things to\\nread.\\nThe first pair of dangling earrings I ever owned were a gift from her .\\nAnd I fucking nod through the phone, because that’ s all I do.\\n“Breathe, okay?” she adds.\\n“Bye.”\\nI hang up, need les pricking my throat, and continue to stare at the\\nbeautiful view , my hair blowing  in the soft breeze and the wild smell of the\\nair so much like a drug. Heady .\\nA woodpecker hollows out a tree in the distance, and the wind  sweeps\\nthrough the aspens and pines, the forest floor growing darker the deeper the\\nwoods go until I can’ t see anything anymore.\\nDo they hike? Jake, Noah, and Kaleb? Do they ever venture farther into\\nthe forest? T ake time to explore?\\nA chainsaw cuts through the silence, loud and buzzing, and I blink, the\\nspell broken. Turning around, I drop my phone on the bed and walk for one\\nof my suitcases, digging out my toiletry bag. Walking for the door, I\\nsqueeze the handle, slowly twisting it.\\nIt squeaks, and I flinch. My parents didn’ t like noise in the morning.\\nStepping softly into the dim hallway, the dark wood floors and paneling\\nlit only by the glow of the two wall sconces and a rustic chandelier , I tiptoe\\npast the room Jake told me was his last night and head for the next door,\\nreaching for the handle.\\nBut before I can grasp it, the door swings open, light spills into the\\nhallway , and a young woman stands there, damn near naked. Her mussed\\nauburn hair hugs her face and hangs just above her bare breasts.\\nJesus… I turn my head away. What the hell? Is she my uncle’ s wife? He\\ndidn’ t mention being married, but he didn’ t say he wasn’ t, either .\\nI cast another quick glance at her, seeing her smile and fold her arms\\nover her chest. “Excuse me,” she says.\\nTaut, flat stomach, smooth skin, no ring on her finger—she wasn’ t his\\nwife. And definitely not the boys’ mother . I have no idea how old Kaleb is, but Jake said Noah was his youngest, and she’s not old enough to have\\ngrown sons.\\nShe looks only a few years older than me, actually . One of the boys’\\ngirlfriends, maybe?\\nShe stands there for a moment, and my shock starts to turn to ire. Like,\\nmove or something? I need to get in.\\n“The difference between pizza  and your opinion is that I asked for\\npizza,” she recites.\\nI falter and turn my head to look at her, but she’s looking down at my\\nsweatshirt. I drop my eyes, seeing the one I’d donned and the writing she\\nwas reading on the front of it.\\nShe chuckles at the words and then slips past me, out of the bathroom. I\\nrush inside, and I’m about to close the door, but then I think better of it and\\ndip my head back into the hallway . Unfortunately , though, I just hear a door\\nclose. She’ s gone before I can see which room she disappeared into.\\nClosing the door, I busy mysel f washing my face, brushing my teeth,\\nand removing the ribbon I use to tie my hair out of my face every night.\\nYears ago, my mother started doing that, because she was told it was\\nhealthier than rubber bands.\\nSo I started doing it, too, for some reason.\\nAfter I brush out my hair, I open  the door just as quietly as my bedroom\\none and peer cautiously into the hallway in case more naked strangers are\\naround. I guess it’ s good to know I’m not cramping their style.\\nSeeing no one, I dart for my room again, smelling the coffee that woke\\nme up drifting up from downsta irs. I make my bed, dress in a pair of jeans\\nand a long-sleeved top, and start to unpack my suitcases, but then I stop just\\nas I’m pulling out a stack of shirts.\\nI might not stay. I put the shirts back and close my suitcase, deciding to\\nwait.\\nI remain  planted  in the middle of the room for another eight seconds,\\nbut as much as I delay , I can’t think of anything else to do in here to put off\\nmaking an appearance. Leaving  the room, I blow out a breath and close the\\ndoor behind me, not stopping before I dive in head first and descend the\\nstairs to get this over with.\\nBut as I step into the living room and look around, my shoulders relax\\njust a hair. Ther e’s no one down  here. A couple of lamps light the spacious\\nroom, and I turn my head left, seeing the kitchen, dimly lit by a few lights hanging over the center island,  empty , as well. I spot the red light of the\\ncoffee machine, though, and pad over in my bare feet, keeping an eye out\\nfor one of the guys.\\nFinding a cup in a dish rack, I pour myself a cup.\\n“Morning.”\\nI jump, the cup nearly slipping out of my hand as the coffee sloshes\\nover the rim. Searing drops land on my thumb, and I hiss.\\nI glance over my shoulder , seeing Jake stroll into the kitchen and open\\nthe refrigerator ,\\n“Morning,” I murmur , brushing the hot liquid of f my skin.\\n“How’d you sleep?” he asks.\\nI cast another look, seeing him take out a drink, sweat already glistening\\nall over his arms, neck, and back as his T-shirt hangs out of his back pocket.\\nIt’s only about seven. How early do they get up?\\n“Fine,” I mumble, taking a paper towel and wiping up the coffee. I\\nactually slept like shit, but that will only open me up to more questions, so\\nit’s easier to lie.\\n“Good,” he replies.\\nBut he just stands there, and I can feel his eyes on me.\\nI take another paper towel and wipe the wooden countertop some more.\\n“Warm enough?” he presses.\\nHuh? I look at him questioningly .\\n“Your bedroom last night?” he says, elaborating. “Was it warm\\nenough?”\\nHis light hair, damp with sweat,  sticks to his forehead and temples as he\\nlooks at me, and I nod, turning away again.\\nBut he doesn’ t leave.\\nHe just stays there, and I feel myself wanting to sigh, because this is the\\npart where people usually expect me to make an effort to carry on a\\nconversation.\\nThe kitchen grows smaller , and the silence more deafening, except for a\\nbird cawing in the distance. I search my brain for something  to say, the\\nawkward seconds stretching and making me want to bolt.\\nBut then he moves closer all of a sudden, and I straighten, on alert as his\\nchest nearly touches my arm. I’m about to move away , but then he reaches\\nin front of me, and I watch as he switches of f the cof fee maker . “I was just keeping it warm for you,” he says, his breath brushing the\\ntop of my head.\\nMy heart starts pumping harder . Keeping it warm…? Oh, the coffee. He\\nleft it on for me.\\n“You have pretty hands,” he points out.\\nI look down at them wrapped around the mug.\\n“Your dad did, too,” he adds, and I can hear the taunt.\\nI pinch my eyebrows together . Was that a dig?\\n“My dad had pretty hands,” I muse, taking a sip without looking  at him.\\n“So real men use chainsaws and pick-up trucks instead of Mont Blancs and\\ncell phones?” I ask.\\nI turn my head, peering up at him, and he narrows his blue eyes on me.\\n“Well, he’ s dead now ,” I tell Jake. “Y ou win.”\\nHe lowers his chin, his stare locked on mine, and I see his jaw flex. I\\nturn away and take another sip of my cof fee.\\nRegardless of whatever bad blood was between him and my father , the\\norphan is the last person he should be targeting with his insul ts. Manners\\nare a thing everywhere. This guy’ s a prick.\\nDespite that, though, my stoma ch warms, and I sip my coffee to cover\\nup my nerves.\\nI feel it. The need to engage.\\nAfter the sadness, anger was my constant companion as a kid. And then\\nthe anger went away, and there was nothing. I forgot how good it felt. The\\ndistraction of my emotions.\\nI like that I don’ t like him.\\n“Alright,” some one calls, and I hear her footsteps enter the kitchen.\\n“I’m out.”\\nI glance over, still feeling Jake’ s eyes on me, and watch the naked\\nwoman—now dressed—strolling up to Jake with a brown leather backpack\\nslung over her shoulder as she wraps an arm around his neck. She leans in,\\nand he hesitates a moment—still looking at me—before he finally turns to\\nher and lets her kiss him.\\nShe’s his, then. I take in the smooth skin of her face, in shado w under\\nher baseball cap, and her tight and toned body . She’ s nowhere near his age.\\nThe guys aren’ t as cut off from civilization as I thought. Until the\\nweather starts, anyway . The tip of her tongue darts out and slips into his mouth for a split-\\nsecond before she pulls away , and I turn back to my coffee, a strange\\nirritation winding its way through me. Will there be lots of people coming\\nand going?\\n“See you tonight?” she asks him.\\n“Maybe.”\\nThere’ s a pause and then he repeats himself.\\n“Maybe.”\\nShe must’ve been pouting.\\nShe plants another kiss on him and leaves, and I exhale, kind of glad he\\ndidn’ t introduce me to another person.\\n“Wanna give me a hand?” Jake asks.\\nI look up at him but forget what I was going to ask. He looks a lot like\\nhis son.\\nMore than I realized last night.\\nThe full head of blond hair, freshly slept on. The lazy half-sm ile. The\\nconstant joke you can see playing behind their eyes. How old is Jake,\\nanyway? My father was forty-nine, and Jake is younger . That’ s all I know .\\nWith sons who are at least twenty , I’d say he’s probably in his early\\nforties?\\nOf course, he could be older . He seems to get a lot of sun, and he stays\\nin shape. My father wasn’ t overweight, but he didn’ t look like this guy .\\nI face forward again and take a sip of my cof fee. “Help with what?”\\n“You’ll see,” he tells me. “Get some shoes on.”\\nHe walks away , calling for Danny and Johnny , and after a mom ent, the\\ndogs follow him out to the shop . I almost roll my eyes. His dogs are named\\nDanny and Johnny? Another Karate Kid  reference.\\nI take a coupl e more gulps of the cooled coffee, dump out the\\nremainder , and spin on my heel, heading back up to my bedroom.\\nAfter I slip on some shoes, I grab my phone to slide it in my back\\npocket but think better of it.\\nI look down at it, hesitating for only a moment before I turn it off and\\nplug it in to char ge.\\nClosing the door behind me, I leave the room and head for the stairs,\\nbriefly training my ear on the son’s door—the one I met, anyway—and\\nwondering if he’ s up yet.\\nBut I don’ t hear anything. Heading out of the house, I slow as I hit the porch, taking in the full\\nview in the light of day and turning my gaze right to see the tip of the peak\\nthrough the trees from this low level.\\nI breathe  deep, my eyes falling closed for a moment and unab le to get\\nenough of the smell of wood and pine. The hairs on my arms stand up from\\nthe chill in the morning air, but it doesn’ t bother me. Trees surround the\\nhouse, and I take in the fat trunks and peer into the forest in the distance,\\nthe floor dark under the canopy . I have a sudden urge to walk. I bet you can\\nwalk for hours without seeing or hearing anyone.\\nThe front deck is huge, just as wide as the inside of the house with an\\noverhang shading half of it and wooden rocking chairs and a swing\\nadorning the space. A couple of trucks sit out front before the land spills\\ndownward to a vast forest with the town in the distance.\\nAt least I think it is. The gravel  road into the property comes from that\\ndirection. I haven’ t seen behin d the house yet, but I assume it takes me\\ndeeper into the forest.\\nGlancing right, I see Jake walking down the driveway and stop in front\\nof the stairs. He’ s put his shirt back on.\\n“You know how to ride?” he asks.\\nHorses or…?\\nI just nod, assuming he means horses.\\n“Do you know how to shoot?”\\nI shake my head.\\n“Do you know how to answer in anything other than nods and one-word\\nsentences?”\\nI stare at him. I’m not unused to that question.\\nWhen I don’t answer , he simply  chuckles, shakes his head, and gestures\\nfor me to follow him.\\nI step off the deck and traipse across a small, sparsely green yard with\\npatches of mud and sporadic puddles. The dew from the overgrown grass\\nsoaks through the bottoms of my jeans and wets the tops of my feet,\\nexposed in my turquoise Tieks, as I trail behind him toward the barn. The\\ngray wood is cracked and decaying near the foundation, and I look up,\\nseeing the hay door open near the roof of the barn, but the main doors on\\nthe bottom are still closed. Before we reach the entrance, he veers left and\\nslides open the door of a lower , attached structure, and I follo w him over the threshold and immediately smell the familiar scent of the animals. It’s a\\nstable.\\nHe heads down to the third stall, and I hang back as he opens it,\\nbringing out a brown mare with some paint markings down her snout and\\non her legs from the knees to the heels. She’s already saddled, and I look\\ndown at my flats, frosted with mud around the sole of the shoes. I have\\nsneakers in my room, but if I stay , I’ll need to get some work boots in town.\\nAnd soon.\\nTaking the reins, he leads the horse out of the stable, and I follow ,\\nseeing Noah walk up to us and toss a couple of shovels into a pile next to\\nthe barn.\\n“Oh, my God, are you okay?” he blurts out, looking at me worried.\\n“Was there an animal attack I didn’ t know about?”\\nWhat?\\nAnd then I see his bewildered stare drop, and I follow his gaze, seeing\\nthe purposeful tears and shred s of my designer skinny jeans that my\\nfamily’ s personal shopper put in my closet a few weeks ago.\\nSlices of thigh peer out betwee n shreds of dark-washed material, and\\nJake laughs under his breath as I look back up to see a lopsided smile on\\nNoah’ s cocky face.\\nI lock my jaw and look away .\\nHe’s teasing. I’m just not in the mood.\\nOf course, I haven’ t been in the mood for years, so I guess this is who I\\nam now .\\nI tuck my hair behind my ear, and he eventually passes, his lips tight\\nwith the laugh he’ s holding in.\\n“Tiernan,” Jake calls.\\nI walk over to where my uncle stands on the other side of the horse and\\nfollow his lead as he holds the stirrup toward me. Reaching up, I fist the\\nreins in one hand and grab hold of the saddle in the other , slipping my left\\nfoot into the stirrup. Hoisting myself up, I swing my leg over and straddle\\nthe horse, fitting my other shoe into the right stirrup. It’s a perfect fit. I\\ndon’t need him to adjust anything. I haven’ t asked what we’re doing or\\nwhere we’re going, knowing it doesn’ t really matter . I won’ t argue.\\nI look around for his horse, but then, all of a sudden, he’s pulling\\nhimself up and plopping down right behind me.\\nWhat is he doing? “I said I know how to ride,” I tell him.\\nBut he reaches in front of me and takes the reins, forcing me to let them\\ngo. I grip the horn of the saddle with both hands, scooching up as far as I\\ncan, because he’ s right there, and I’m practically in his lap.\\nMy heart starts beating a little harder as irritation crawls under my skin.\\n“I don’ t need help,” I tell him.\\nHe only clicks his tongue and nudges the horse, setting us of f around the\\nbarn. We round  the wooden fence and gallop into the forest as the horse\\nclimbs the steep hill, sending us under the shade of the trees, and I squeeze\\nmy fists around the horn to try to keep myself from sliding backward.\\nBut as much as I try , I still feel his body there.\\nThe day grows darker as the trees shield us from the sun, and the air\\ncools, but something pleasant stirs at the feel of the animal under me. Her\\nmuscles workin g against my legs to get us up the hill. My pulse starts to\\nrace a little, but I don’t hate it. A little refreshing, actually . He’s solid\\nbehind me, and I feel secure. For the moment.\\n“Are you uncomfortable?” he asks.\\nHis voice vibrates against my back.\\nBut I don’ t answer .\\n“Are you comfortable?” he presses instead.\\nStill, I stay silent. What does it matter anyway? He imposed himself\\ndespite my protest. Will it matte r if I’m comfortable with him on the horse\\nor not?\\nHe doesn’ t care. He just wants a response out of me.\\nHis sigh hits my ear. “Yeah, your father could piss me off without\\nsaying much, too.”\\nBut I can’t hear him. His legs rest against every inch of mine  as I sit\\nnestled between his thighs.\\nSnug. Protected.\\nAre you uncomfortable?\\nI don’t know , but I’m aware that maybe I should be. This is weird. We\\nshouldn’ t be sitting like this.\\nWe continue up the hill, the rock and dirt kicking up under the horse as I\\nlook around, seeing the house behind us down below . The terrain evens out,\\nand Jake pushes  the horse a little faster as I relax into his hold around me,\\nboth of us bouncing up and down in the saddle. He blow s a couple times, like something in his face, and then his fingers\\nbrush my neck. I tense, the touch making me shiver .\\n“Do me a favor , okay?” he says as he swipes my hair over my right\\nshoulder . “Keep  your hair tied back as much as possible. We have lots of\\nmachines that can snag it.”\\nI take over , smoothing my hair over my shoulder and out of his face.\\nWe stop at the top of the hill. “Water tower , barn, shop…” he calls out,\\npointing as we turn and look over the cliff to his property below . “There’ s a\\ngreenhouse over that hill, too.”\\nI follow his gaze down to where the house sits through the trees in the\\ndistance below us, getting a decent view of the entire ranch. The house is\\nhappily situated  in the center , the back of it facing us, with the attached\\ngarage to the left—or shop, I assume he’s referring to—and then a barn on\\nthe other side of that. To the right is a water tower . The rocky hill we sit\\natop of sits behind the house, and I’d imagine there’ s a propane  tank and a\\ngenerator somewhere on the property .\\nThe leaves dance with the morning breeze, and something flaps its\\nwings to my right as a steady , soft noise pounds in the distance. Water,\\nmaybe?\\nJake pulls away  from the edge , and we keep going, still farther away\\nfrom the house and deeper into the forest, and I look down, seeing his\\nfingers wrapped around each strap of the reins, nearly resting on my thighs.\\nHis arms lock me in, and despite the chill of the morning, I’m not cold.\\n“You can’t take the truck up in here, but the horses and ATVs do well,”\\nhe tells me. “Have Noah show you the ropes with the four-wheelers before\\nyou use one, okay?”\\nI nod. I did a camp for extreme sports one summer , but he’ll probably\\nwant his son to show me the ropes anyway .\\nWe keep going, and even though I’m a little hungry after not having\\neaten for so long and craving another coffee, because my eyelids are\\nweighing heavy with the relaxing rocking of the ride, I stay quiet. I’m not\\nthinking about anything out here, and it’ s nice.\\nI close my eyes.\\nBut after a few moments, the rush of water grows louder , and the horse\\nstops. I open my eyes, seeing we’re at the edge of a cliff. I look into the\\ndistance.\\nThe peak. My heart thumps, and I stop breathing for a moment as I take in the now\\nunobstructed view .\\nMy God.\\nA narrow  valley  runs below us between two mountains, a long waterfall\\nrushing over one of them and into the river. Between the two mountains, in\\nthe distance, stands the peak. Dark gray rock, skirted with greenery . It’s\\nbeautiful.\\n“Like it?” Jake asks.\\nI nod.\\n“Do you like it?” he asks again in a stern voice, and I know he wants me\\nto use my words.\\nI just keep staring ahead, only able to whisper . “l love it.”\\n“You can come back as much as you want, now that you know the\\nway.” I feel him move behind me and the saddle shifts a little. “But you\\nneed to carry protection with you when you leave the house, you\\nunderstand?”\\nI nod again, barely listening as I gape at the view .\\nBut he takes my chin and turns my head to face him.\\n“This is very important,” he insists. “Do you understand? This isn’t\\nL.A. It’s not even Denver . We have black bears, mountain lions, coyotes,\\nthe occasional rattlesnake… You need to have your eyes open. You’re on\\ntheir turf now .”\\nI pull away from his grasp and face forward again, but then I see him\\nbring something up from behind me, and I tear my gaze away from the peak\\nagain to see that he holds a gun.\\nOr a rifle.\\nSliding the chamber open, he shows me the long, sharp golden bullets\\nand then yanks the bolt back, chambering a bullet and making sure I’m\\nwatching as he does it.\\n“Do you see the broken rope bridge hanging over there?”\\nI look across the river, seeing the remnants of a wooden rope bridge\\nhanging down the rock wall.\\nJesus. My heart skips a beat, taking in the drop below . Was that bridge\\nactually a thing at one time?\\nHe puts the rifle in my hands. “Aim for it.”\\nI grip the long firearm, the steel barrel tucked into a dark wood  casing,\\nand I’m kind of thankful. At least he’ s not wanting to talk. Did he shoot that deer with this?\\nI let out a breath.\\nNot likely. The mountain man probably has a whole cabinet of these\\nthings.\\nHesitating a moment, I finally lift the rifle, positioning the butt against\\nmy shou lder and wrapping my hand around the guard with my finger on the\\ntrigger . I close my left eye and peer down the line of sight, toward the\\nmuzzle.\\n“Okay ,” he tells me. “Now calm  your breathing. The bullet is already\\nchambered, so just look down the sight, and line up—”\\nI pull the trigger , the bullet firing out of the barrel, echoing into the air,\\nand a pop hits the rock wall down the opposite side, kicking up rock dust\\nand cutting the board in half. Both parts fall and dangle by their respective\\nropes against the clif f.\\nA breeze kicks up my hair a little, and I lower the rifle, opening both of\\nmy eyes as the thunder of the shot disappears in the distance and the\\npeaceful sound of the waterfall fills the air again.\\nJake sits behind me, still, and I hand the gun back to him and turn my\\nattention back up to the peak, seeing some kind of a large bird breeze past\\nmy line of sight.\\nHe clears his throat. “Well…I was going to suggest the boys empty\\nsome beer bottles for you tonight, but…looks like you don’t need the\\npractice. I thought you said you couldn’ t shoot.”\\n“I can’t shoot animals,” I tell him. “I thought that’s what you were\\nasking.”\\nThe peak is massive. But so close. Such a strange feeling, some thing so\\nbig, reminding you that you’re small, but also reminding you that you’re\\npart of a world full of magnificent things. What a great thing to be able to\\nsee—and relearn—every day .\\nJake dismounts the horse, and I ease back in the seat, which is still\\nwarm from his body .\\n“I’m going to check some traps, so I’ll walk home,” he says.\\nI look down, meeting his eyes as I take the reins now .\\n“Start breakfast when you get back to the house,” he tells me. “After\\nyou unsaddle the horse, of course.”\\nI narrow my eyes without thinking. Cook?\\nI have no problem helping out, but why that? I look away . “I’ll pitch in, but I’m not staying in the kitchen.”  I’m not\\nsure if I have a problem with cooking or because that’ s where he wants me.\\nPut the girl at the stove, because of course she doesn’ t know how to ride\\na horse or shoot, right?\\n“Do you know how to tend crops instead?” he asks.\\nI straighten my spine, already knowing what he’ s getting at.\\n“Weed, water , fertilize?” he goes on. “Aerate the land? Plant? Do you\\nknow how to prepare to store some of those crops to feed the horses and\\nlivestock over the winter months?”\\nI still don’ t look at him.\\n“Milk cows?” he continues, enjoying himself. “Train horses? Operate a\\nchainsaw? Skin a deer?”\\nYeah, okay .\\n“Can fruits and vegetables? Drive a tractor? Build a motorcycle from\\nscratch?”\\nI lock my jaw , but I don’ t answer .\\n“So cooking breakfast, it is,” he chirps. “We all do our part, Tiernan. If\\nyou want to eat.”\\nI’ll do my part and then some, but he could ask instead of give orders.\\nI turn my head toward him again. “You’re not my father , you know? I\\ncame here of my own free will, and I can leave whenever I want.”\\nBut instead of walking away or ignoring me, a hint of mischief hits his\\neyes, and he smiles.\\n“Maybe,” he taunts. “Or maybe I’ll decide that you’d benefit from some\\ntime here and that you can’ t leave, after all.”\\nMy heart quickens.\\n“At least until I see you laugh,” he adds. “Or yell or scream or cry or\\nfight or joke, and all in more than nods and one-word answers.”\\nI stare at him, and I feel my eyes burn with anger .\\nHe cocks an eyebrow . “Maybe I’ll decide to honor your parents ’ wishes\\nand keep you until you’re of age.”\\n“I’ll be ‘of age’ in ten weeks.”\\n“We’ll be snowed in in eight.” And he laughs, backing away from me.\\nI feel the ghost of a snarl on my lips.\\n“Burn the bacon , Tiernan,” he instructs as he walks away . “We like it\\nthat way .”  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI sling the saddle over the bench in the barn, not caring if that’s where I’m\\nsupposed to put it or not.\\nHe won’ t keep me here if I don’ t want to stay , will he?\\nWhether or not he intends to, actually scares me less than knowing he\\ncan. I came here thinking I was a guest and him having power it wouldn’ t\\neven occur to him to use.\\nWell, it did, I guess. Maybe he thinks he can get rent out of me.\\nOr maybe he thinks me being a woman makes me a good cook? I’m not.\\nI exit the stable and head for the house, taking a shortcut through the\\nattached shop and walking towa rd the door that will take me right into the\\nkitchen.\\nI shake my head at myself. I can’ t go home.\\nAnd I don’t want to go back to Brynmor . God, the idea of seeing  anyone\\nI know… I close my eyes. Or smelling that house .\\nI can’t face it. The stark white walls. Sitting in classrooms crowded with\\npeople I don’ t know how to talk to.\\nMy stom ach turns, and I stop, leaning my forehead into something\\nhanging from the ceiling in the shop. I wrap my arm around a punching bag\\nand close my eyes.\\nI can’ t go home.\\nI grip the leather , clenching it in my fist, and everything—m y new\\nreality—starts sinking in. It doesn ’t matter where I go— how I change my surroundings or run\\nfrom all the places and people I don’t want to see. I’m still me. Running,\\nleaving, hiding…\\nThere’ s no escape.\\nAs liquid heat spreads down my arm I fist my palm and hit the bag, my\\nhand barely denting the leather . I do it again and again, my pathetic little\\npunches growing  harder , because I’m fucked up and tired and confused… I\\ndon’t know how to feel better .\\nI suck in air through my teeth, finally rearing back and swinging my fist\\ninto the bag. The chains creak as it tries to swing, but I still have my other\\narm wrapped around it.\\nMaybe I’ll decide to honor your parents’ wishes and keep you until\\nyou’r e of age.\\nI grit my teeth, a sudden burst of energy flooding me, and I release the\\nbag, step back, and swing again, planting my right fist into the bag.\\nAt least until I see you laugh. The anger warm s my body , and I throw\\nanother punch. Or yell or scream or cry or fight or joke, and all in more\\nthan nods and one-wor d answers.\\nI slam my fist again.\\nAnd again.\\nI growl.  “We’ll be snowed in in eight,” I mock his words to me in a\\nwhisper .\\nI shove my fist into the bag two more times and then step back,\\nswinging my back leg into the bag once. Then twice. And again.\\nAnd then I just let him leave and didn’ t say anything, even when he\\ninstructed me on how he likes his damn bacon cooked. I mean, if someone\\nis doing something nice for you—you know , like cooking breakfast—you\\ndon’t balk at how it’ s cooked. Y ou eat it.\\nGod, I wish I had some vegan bacon to really make his day. Amusement\\npulls at my lips, but I force it back.\\nI keep hitting and kicking the bag, a light sweat grazing my brow as I\\nthink of all the things I could’ve responded with. Why does it bug me so\\nmuch I didn’ t get the last word?\\nWhy do I let everything  go and never say anything?\\nI throw my fist into the bag and someone is suddenly there, holding it\\nfrom the other side.\\n“Hi,” Noah says, peering around the bag at me. He looks amused, and I halt, standing up straight. Was he watch ing me?\\nWas I talking to myself?\\nHis eyes crinkle a little more, and I see a self-satisfied grin peek out.\\n“Don’ t stop,” he tells me.\\nThe dark blue T-shirt sets off the color of his eyes, and the same\\nbaseball cap holds his hair back  where it sits backward on his head. He and\\nhis father look a lot alike.\\nI drop my eyes and back off, breathing hard. The muscles in my\\nstomach burn.\\nBut he keeps egging me on. “Come on.” He pats the bag where my last\\npunch landed. “He can piss off a saint. Why do you think I hung this\\npunching bag up in the first place?”\\nI press my lips together , still not moving.\\nHe sighs and stands up straig ht. “Okay . Are you making breakfast,\\nthen?”\\nI dig in my eyebrows, unable  to stop myself, and twist my body ,\\nswinging my leg with full force into the punching bag. He shoves himself\\naway from the bag just before my foot lands and stands back wide-eyed\\nwith his palms up. I watch the bag swing back and forth.\\nI wasn’ t trying to hit him. It would’ve just been a happy coincidence.\\nBut my legs still feel charged, and I almost wish my uncle would walk\\nin right now , so I could ask him to hold the bag instead.\\nI’m angry .\\nI’m actually angry .\\nAnd it feels good.\\nI’m still here.\\nNoah breaks into a chuckle and comes forward, hooking an arm around\\nmy neck. “Y ou’ve got spunk.”\\nI’m too spent to pull away and let him lead me around, walking  us both\\ninto the house.\\n“Come on. Help me make breakfast,” he says.\\n \\n \\nI place the third plate on the table and drop a fork and butter knife next to it,\\nmoving to the cabinet to put that fourth plate away . “No, no,” Noah says, kicking the fridge closed and dumping the butter\\nand jam on the table. “Put the fourth plate down. Kaleb can show up\\nanytime.”\\nI glance  at the table and then turn back to the cabinet, slipping the extra\\nplate back inside. “Kaleb has a plate on the table.”\\n“You’re not eating?”\\n“Yes, she is,” Jake suddenly says, walking into the kitchen.\\nHe heads for the fridge and pulls out a pitcher of juice and places it in\\nthe center of the table, pouring himself a cup of cof fee before he sits.\\n“I’m not hungry ,” I tell him.\\nMoving to the sink, I rinse off the knife and spatula Noah just finished\\nwith.\\n“You didn’ t have dinner ,” Jake points outs. “Sit.”\\n“I’m not hungry .”\\nAnd before he says anything else, I stroll out of the kitchen and up the\\nstairs. I feel his eyes on my back, and the farther I go away from them, the\\nmore I brace myself for a confrontation.\\nBut he doesn’ t chase after me.\\nHe lets me go, and in a mome nt, I’m in my room, closing the door\\nbehind me.\\nThe truth is I’m starving.\\nPangs hit my stomach, and the scrambled eggs I made—while Noah\\nwas busy burning the bacon—looked amazing.\\nLuckily Noah didn’ t press for much conversation while we were\\ncooking, but if I eat with them , I’ll have to talk to them. I’ll wait until\\nthey’re back outside and then scrounge up something.\\nThe green light on my phone flashes from where it lays on the bed, and\\nI walk over and pick it up.\\nUnlocking the phone, I see my home screen with my email and social\\nmedia apps, all dog-eared with dozens of notifications. Twitter alone has\\nninety-nine plus alerts.\\nA knot tightens in my stomach.\\nI rarely even use Facebook, Twitter seemed an efficient way to follow\\nthe news, and I got Instagram due to peer pressure to keep up with bunk-\\nmates from summer camps whom I no longer remember .\\nMy thum b hove rs over Twitter , and I know I shouldn’ t look. I’m not\\nready to face things. But I tap the app on my screen anyway , the notification feed updating.\\n \\nCondolences for your loss… says one person.\\n \\nI scroll through the notifications, some of them direct tweets of\\nsympathies and some of them where I’m tagged in the conversation.\\n \\nBrave girl. Stay str ong, writes RowdyRed.\\n \\nAnd another directly to me. How does a mother decide to abandon her\\nchild for her husband? I’m so sorry . You deserved better .\\n \\nShut up! comes someone else’s response to that tweet.  You have no idea\\nwhat they wer e going thr ough…\\n \\nI scan tweet after tweet, and it doesn’ t take long for me to lose what\\nlittle interest I had in checking my DMs.\\n \\nPeople yelling at me, because they can’t yell at my parents.  People\\nyelling at each other in conversation.\\n \\nSuicide is self-mur der. Mur der is the gravest of sins.\\n \\nYour body belongs to God. T aking your life away fr om him is stealing!\\n \\nAt least your mother made her contribution to the world, writes one\\nasshole, caption ing a nearly nude picture of my mother from  one of her\\nearlier films.\\n \\nI close my eyes and don’ t open them again until I’ve scrolled past.\\nAnd it just gets uglier as they carry on their conversation, either\\noblivious or too callous to care that I’m being tagged in everything they say .\\n \\nShe hasn’ t even made a statement. I think she has like Asper ger’s or\\nsomething.\\n \\nYeah, have you seen pictur es of her? It’ s like emotion doesn’ t register .  \\nAnd then ‘Deep State’ Tom chimes in with his gem of wisdom:\\nAsper ger’s is the modern-day pussy’s excuse for what we called  back in my\\nday being a cold bitch.\\n \\nI’m not cold.\\n \\nAnd, of course, others are worried about my father ’s unfinished\\nprojects: Who’ s finishing the Sun Hunter trilogy with de Haas gone now?\\n \\nI feel like I shou ld say something. One tweet or whatever , even though I\\ndon’t think it’s important for these people to hear me, but I feel compelled\\nto remind them that a human is here, and I…\\nI shake my head, closing my eyes again.\\nI don’ t want them to think I didn’ t love my parents.\\nEven though I’m not sure I did.\\nI swallow and start typing out a tweet.\\n \\nThank you for all the support, everyone, as I…\\n \\nAs I what? Mou rn their loss? I stop, my fingers hovering over the letters\\nbefore I backspace and delete what I wrote.\\n \\nI try again. Thank you for the thoughts and prayers during this\\ndifficult…\\n \\nNope. Delete. Everything I write feels insincere. I’m not emotional,\\nespecially publicly .\\nI wish I could express myself.  I wish this were easier . I wish I was\\ndifferent and…\\n \\nI wish… I type.\\n \\nBut nothing comes.\\nI hesitat e a moment, the urge to speak there but not the courage, and I\\ndiscard the draft, closing out the app. Pressing my thumb to the Twitter icon, I drag it to the trash and do the\\nsame with my Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and email. Going into the\\napp store, I uninstall each one, cutting myself off. I want to speak, but I’m\\nnot ready to deal with the response to whatever I say, so I take away the\\ntorture. The accounts still exist, just not my immediate access to them.\\nPlugging my phone back into the charger and far away from my person,\\nI spend the next hour unpackin g my suitcases and re-arranging the room,\\ndespite myself. I never actually decided I would stay, but I know I’m not\\nleaving today , and I need something to do that keeps me away from them.\\nUnderthings in the top drawer , then night clothes, workout clothes, and\\nT-shirts. I hang up everything else—jackets, blouses, shirts, pants, jeans…\\nLeft to right, dark to light.\\nI arrange all of my shoes on the floor of the closet, knowing my heels\\nwon’ t see the light of day here, but I expected as much. No one to dress for\\nsounds fine to me.\\nI stick the few magazines and books I’d brought on the empty built-in\\nbookshelf and set my make-up cases, hair dryer , and irons neatly next to the\\ndesk and then walk my shampoo and conditioner into the bathroom. I set\\nmy soaps on the edge of the tub before pulling out my toothbrush and\\nswiping some toothpaste across the bristles.\\nFinishing my teeth, I secure my toothbrush back inside its travel tube\\nand take that and my toothpaste back into my bedroom, setting them both\\non the bedside table. I always kept my toothbrush in my bathroom back\\nhome, but only because I was the only one to use the bathroom.\\nBut men are gross. They leave  the toilet seat up, and according to a\\nstudy I once read, fecal matter sprays into the air when toilets flush. The\\nbacteria can get on everything. No, thank you.\\nI brush out my hair, pull it up into a ponytail, and then look around the\\nneat bedroom for something. Anything.\\nI don’t want to leave the room, and I might be repacking tomor row, but\\nif nothing else, at least I didn’ t think about my parents while I was\\nunpacking. Or while I was mad at Jake earlier .\\nBlowing out a breath, I walk out of the room, closing the door behind\\nme, and head downstairs. A drill whirs from the shop, and I hear a pounding\\nin the front of the house, so I head outside, knowing I don’t know  shit about\\nbuilding motorcycles. Jake stands off to my left, planting his arm against the house and\\nhammering a piece of siding.\\n“Can I help?” I ask reluctantly .\\nBut I don’ t look him in the eye.\\nHe stops hammering, and out of the corner of my eye I see him look\\nover at me.\\n“Come and hold this,” he instructs.\\nI step down of f the porch.\\nTreading throug h the grass, I approach his side and fit my hands next to\\nhis, taking over holding the board for him. He points a nail at the board and\\npounds that one in before adding two more.\\nHe reaches down to pick up another piece of wood, and I follow his\\nlead, helping him, but then I catch sight of something on his waist. His T-\\nshirt is tucked back into his back pocket again, and I try to make out the\\ntattoo.\\nMy Mexico . It’s in dark blue script, an arch over his left hip, on the side\\nof his torso, just above his jeans line.\\nI hold the next board for him as he puts a nail into the center , and then I\\nspot another hammer in the nearby toolbox and take it out with a nail from\\nthe cof fee can.\\nI place the point  on the wood and Jake taps the space about an inch over\\nfrom where I have it. “Right there,” he instructs and swipes his hand up,\\nshowing the line of nails on all the previous boards. “Follow the pattern.”\\nI nod, moving the nail. I tap, tap, tap, aware of his eyes on me.\\n“Here, like this,” he says and reaches toward me.\\nBut I pull the hammer and nail away , seeing him immediately back of f.\\nPutting it back in place, I hammer the nail into the house, accidently\\nhitting the edge and bending the piece of metal. I clench my teeth and dig\\nout the nail, replacing it with another and trying again.\\nHe’s still staring at me.\\n“I won’ t learn anything if you don’ t give me a chance,” I tell him.\\nHe moves, a hint of humor in his voice. “I didn’ t say anything.”\\nWe continue working in silenc e, both of us lifting board after board,\\npounding nail after nail. My pace quickens, and he watches me less and\\nless, probably because I’m not slowing him down anymore, although this is\\na two-pe rson job. Why wasn’ t Noah helping him? He’s in the garage, but\\nthis would’ve moved a lot faster than trying to do it alone. Noah’ s words from this mornin g come back to me, and the meaning\\nbehind them finally hits me now , hours later .\\nThey don’ t get along, do they?\\nAnd I almost smile a little. I suddenly feel a slight measure of\\ncamaraderie with Noah.\\nJake picks up a board, and I take my end, both of us fitting  it right\\nunderneath the previous piece of siding, but as I slide my hand down its\\nlength for a better hold, something sharp digs into my skin, and I hiss.\\nI drop my end of the board and bring my hand up, seeing a long, thick\\npiece of wood imbedded into my palm.\\nWincing, I gently tug at the half still sticking out, increasing the force\\nwhen it doesn’ t budge. A sting shoots through my hand, and I need more\\nlight.\\nBut before I can turn around to head into the house, Jake takes my hand\\nand inspects the splinter .\\nI try to pull away . “I got it.”\\nBut he ignores me.\\nFocusing on my hand, he presses down on my skin where the sliver is\\nembedded, holding it in place before he snaps it in half, breaking off the\\nslack.\\nI jerk, sucking in air between my teeth.\\n“Who taught you to shoot?” he asks, poking at the rest of the splinter . “I\\ncan’t imagine Hannes taking up any outdoor activity that didn’t include a\\nyacht or a golf cart.”\\nI shoot my eyes up to his face. That’ s two digs today .\\nJake’ s eyes flash to me for a moment like he’s waiting for me to say\\nsomething. “Y ou’re not sad at the mention of him.”\\nIt’s an observation, not a question.\\nMy shoulders tense, a little self-conscious, because I know what he\\nexpects.\\nI’m not acting right, and he’ s noticed.\\nI look away , hearing the faint, high-pitched sounds of motorcycle\\nengines growing closer . “I don’ t want to talk about my father .”\\n“Yeah, me neither .”\\nHe digs his thumb under the splinter , trying to push it up and out, and I\\ntry to yank my hand away . “Stop that.”\\nBut he tightens his hold and pulls my hand back to him. “Stop moving.” While he keeps working the splinter , trying to push it out, I hear the\\nbuzz of engines grow louder and spot a team of dirt bikes speeding up the\\ngravel driveway . About five guys crowd the area behind my uncle’ s truck\\nand pull to a stop, pulling off helmets and chuckling to each other. They’re\\nall dressed in colorful attire, looking very Motocross. Or Supercross or\\nwhatever it is they do here.\\nNoah trots out of the shop and approaches one of the guys. “Hey , man.”\\nThey shake hand s, and he contin ues wiping the grease off his fingers as\\nhe walks around the bikes, taking a look at what the guys are driving.\\n“Hey , how’ s it going?” he greets another . “Did you run today?”\\nThey talk, and Jake tightens his hold on my hand before spinning\\naround and pulling me after him into the shop.\\nHeading over to a workbench, he flips on a lamp and holds my palm\\nunder it to get a better view .\\n“I’m sorry ,” he says.\\n“What?”\\nI turn my eyes on him.\\n“The taunt about your dad,” he explains, still inspecting my splinter .\\n“I’m a prick. I’m sure I screwed up my own kids ten different ways to\\nSunday , so I have no room to talk.”\\nI turn my head, seeing Noah make the rounds to his friends, one of them\\nstill straddling his bike and lighting a cigarette. He peers over at me.\\n“You’re dif ferent than I thought you’d be,” Jake says softly .\\nI look back to him.\\n“Complicated,” he explains. “Tough to read. And even if I could read\\nyou, I’m not sure I can be a comfort to you.” He gives a weak smirk. “I’m\\nnot upset by their deaths, T iernan, but I am sorry you are.”\\nI turn my eyes away again, toward the guys outside. “I’m not upset.”\\nThe guy in Noah’ s group of friends with the frat boy haircut and crystal\\neyes is still staring at me, a mischievous smile playing on his lips as he\\nsmokes. Is that Kaleb?\\nI feel Jake’ s eyes on me, too.\\n“I don’t want to talk about my father ,” I state again before he has the\\nchance to keep going.\\nBut pain slices through my hand like a spider bite, and I hiss, meeting\\nhis eyes again.\\nWhat the hell? That hurt! But as I glare up at him, the splinter is forgotten, and I stop breathing\\nfor a moment.\\nWarmth spreads up my neck as his gaze hovers down on mine, hard and\\nangry , but… kind of puzzled, too. Like he’ s trying to figure me out.\\nHis eyes aren’ t blue. I thought they were. Like Noah’ s. They’re green.\\nLike summer grass.\\nA breez e blows  through the open doors of the shop, the chatter and\\nlaughter outside  miles away as a wisp of my hair, loose from the ponytail,\\nblows across my lips.\\nHis eyes drop to my mouth, and I stop breathing, everything  getting\\nwarm.\\nA trickle  of sweat glides down his neck, and the hair on my arms stands\\non end, aware of his naked chest.\\nWe’re too close.\\nI…\\nI swallow , my mouth sandy and dry .\\nHe finally blinks a few times, and then he brings the palm of my hand\\nup to his lips, the warmth of his mouth trying to suck the wood from my\\nhand.\\nMy mouth falls open a little as his teeth gnaw and tease the splin ter, and\\nmy skin is sucked and tickled.\\nMy fingertips graze the scruf f on his cheek.\\nI can do that . I don’ t need your help.\\nBut I can’ t manage to say it out loud.\\n“Oh, shit,” I hear someone say outside.\\nPulling my attention away from  my uncle, I look outside to see Noah\\nchecking out someone’ s bike.\\nThe magazine cover turns his eyes on me again. “Who’ s that?”  he asks\\nNoah.\\nNoah follows his gaze and sees me but ignores him.\\n“Stay away from the local guys, you understand?” Jake tells me.\\nI look up at him.\\nHe continues, “If you get a boyfriend, you won’ t be able to see him\\nonce we’re snowed in anyway . Besides, they’re not your type.”\\n“How do you know?”\\n“Because I’m telling you they’re  not your type,” he shoots back. “I will\\nlet you know when one is.” What a Neanderthal. For Christ’ s sake.\\nI keep quiet, no desire to argue with him. I’m not looking for a guy, but\\nI can take care of myself. His sons grew up with him in their faces. I’m\\nused to making my own decisions.\\n“They’re bored, ” he tells me. “And when you’re bored, you only want\\ntwo things, and beer doesn’ t last forever .”\\nSo they’re different from other guys my age, how? I know what\\nteenagers are into. I know what men want from women. I’m not a fragile\\nrose petal.\\nHis teeth work my palm, and flutters hit my stomach.\\nI look up at him, the fact that I now live with three healthy , semi-young\\nmales, all of who are also part of the “local guys” he’ s warning me about.\\n“You don’t get bored up here during the winter?” I taunt, dropping my\\nvoice to just between us. “When the beer runs out?”\\nHis eyes tighten at the corners, getting my meaning. Are he and his sons\\nany different? Will there be more naked women hanging out around the\\nbathroom?\\nHe finally gets hold of the splinter and pulls it out, but I don’t look\\naway , even as it stings.\\nHe lowers my hand, rubbing his thumb over the small wound.\\n“It’s fine.” I pull it away , wiping whatever little blood was there.\\n“Are you sorry you came?” he asks me.\\nSurprisingly , I’m not taken off guard by the question. Probably because\\nI wouldn’ t be scared to be rude if the truth was in the negative.\\n“I don’ t know ,” I tell him honestly .\\nI’m not happy , but I wouldn’ t be happy at home or at Brynmor or\\nprobably anywh ere. I didn’ t expect to be happy coming here, so it doesn’ t\\nmatter .\\nI look out of the shop, all of the guys revving their engines and turning\\ntheir bikes around to leave. Noah backs away , obviously not joining them.\\n“Do you like being here?” Jake presses.\\n“I don’ t know ,” I tell him again.\\n“Where would you rather be?”\\nI don’ t know . Why does he want to know? I don’ t…\\nI finally meet his eyes, chewing the corner of my mouth.\\n“I don’t want to be…” I trail off, trying to find the words. “I don’t want\\nto be…” But the sentence comes out soun ding complete. Like that’s my answer . I\\ndon’t want to be.\\nHis eyes turn guarded as he looks at me.\\n“I don’ t want to be anywhere,” I quickly say .\\nI might’ve had some misperceptions about what to expect here, but I at\\nleast thought three single men wouldn’ t desire a lot of touchy-feely\\nconversation. This guy seems to want to connect, and it’ s aggravating me.\\nI turn and start to walk out of the shop, just as the dirt bikes are all\\nspeeding away .\\n“Make some sandwiches, please,” Jake calls after me. “Just put them in\\nthe fridge to grab and go. Doesn’ t matter what kind. W e’re not picky .”\\n \\n \\nWe’re not picky .\\nI walk into the house, head for the kitchen, and yank open both fridge\\ndoors. Then I pull open the crisper and freezer drawers below as I take\\nstock of everything I have to work with.\\nHe’s keeping me busy. I should be grateful. And he’s giving me a chore\\nwhere I don’ t have to talk to anyone. I like to cook. I can listen to music and\\nbe left alone.\\nAnd sandwiches aren’ t hard.\\nI tap my fingers on the door handle as I hold open the fridge. I don’t\\nknow . He just rubs me the wron g way, like he’s enjoying his guardianship a\\nlittle too much. My parents wouldn’ t have cared if I’d had orgies in my\\nbedroom as long as nothing wound up on Snapchat.\\nThis guy , though…\\nAlready he’s flexing his dominance. Mind you, I have no interest in\\norgies—or men right now, anyway—but I’ve been raising myself for years,\\nand now I have to downshift. It’s too much to ask. I may only be seventeen,\\nbut that’ s only on paper .\\nWhy the hell does he want lunch now anyway? Breakfast was an hour\\nago.\\nAnd at that, my stomach growls . I falter a moment, holding my hand to\\nmy stomach.\\nI didn’ t eat breakfast.\\nOr anything since the berries at breakfast yesterday . Pulling out lunch meat, the condiments, and some lettuce, I get busy,\\nbuilding some sandwiches, taking bites of one to get somethi ng into me,\\nand then I cut them diagonally and place the triangles onto a large plate. I\\nfind the Saran wrap in a drawer on the island and wrap up the tray, setting it\\nin the fridge.\\nNot sure if that’s their lunch, but that’s all they’re getting out of me. I’ll\\nsee if he needs me to run into town for anything. I could use a drive.\\nBut just as I go to close the refrigerator door, I see a drop of water hit\\nthe glass  just above the crisper drawer . Bending down, I put my hand in a\\nsmall puddle of water .\\nIt’s leaking.\\nPeering into the back of the fridge, I try to gauge where it’s coming\\nfrom and see the motor frosted over and caked with ice.\\nI stand up straight and chew the corner of my mouth. Should I tell him?\\nI’m sure he knows.\\nSpotting their iPad on the counter , I grab it and turn it on. A password\\nprompt comes up, and right away I enter “nomercy ,” hazarding  a guess. It\\nimmediately unlocks.\\nHeading to YouTube, I check the model of the refrigerator and bring up\\nsome videos. Over the next hour, I empty the refrigerator and work it away\\nfrom the wall, putting all of my weight into pulling it out and unplugging\\nthe power. Then, I swipe some tools from the shop and get to work\\nfollowing the video’ s directions, chipping away and unthawing  the motor ,\\nrepairing the leak in the tube, and reassembling everything. I’m not sure if it\\nwill work, or how mad he’ll be if I made it worse, but that’s a perk of being\\nrich. I’ll buy him a new one.\\nI stop twisting the screwdriver , realization hitting all of a sudden. Can I\\nbuy him a new one? I mean, minors can’t inherit money . Their guardians\\nhave power of attorney until they’re of age.\\nSo technically , my inheritance is completely in his hands. Unless my\\nparents put something into a trust, which their lawyer might ’ve had the\\nforesight to do, but…\\nShould I be worried? The money never mattered, but that’s only\\nbecause I always had it. I talk a big talk, but if I can’t pay for college, then\\nthat changes things. Did my parents trust him with me and my well-being,\\nor…was there just not anyone else? I don’t know if I can trust him, but I definitely didn’ t trust them to do what was right for me. This guy has my\\nfuture in his grip.\\nFor the next ten weeks anyway .\\nDespite the kick up of my pulse, I forge ahead—lost in thoug ht—and\\nrefasten the motor cover and reach behind the appliance, plugg ing it back\\nin. The motor gently purrs and cool air starts to breathe back into the\\nmachine. So far so good.\\n“You did that?” I hear someone ask.\\nI turn my head, seeing Noah standing at the island, shirt off, sweaty , and\\nout of breath, as he looks at the video on the iPad I have proppe d up on the\\ncounter .\\nLooking over to where the leak was, he sees it’ s now dry .\\n“Good job,” he says. “W e’ve been meaning to get on that.”\\nI turn back around, but not before I take another quick glance, noticing\\nhis torso  and arms are complete ly clean of any tattoos. I don’t know why\\nthat strikes me as of f. Maybe since his father has one, I thought he would.\\nGetting busy, I reload all of the food into the fridge, faintly hearing\\nsome kind of machine running outside and guessing it must be Jake.\\n“So, when do you turn eighteen?” Noah asks.\\nI don’ t stop as he just leans against the island, watching me.\\n“November first.”\\n“You gonna leave then?”\\nI glance at him, taking a moment to realize what he means.\\nI don’t have to stay now. Didn’ t his father tell him he gave me a choice\\non the phone?\\n“I would leave,” he offers. “I would leave in a heartbeat. You’re here,\\nand you don’ t have to be. I have to be here, but I don’ t want to be.”\\n“It’s as good a place as any,” I reply softly , placing some condiments\\nback onto the door shelf.\\n“Why?”\\n“Because you’re still you, no matter where you go,” I retort.\\nI stop and look up at him, his sweaty hair falling in his eyes and his hat\\nhanging from his fingers. He still looks puzzled.\\n“There are just as many happy people in Cleveland as there are in\\nParis,” I explain. “And just as many sad ones.”\\n“Yeah, well, I’d rather be sad on a beach.” I snort, smiling despite myself. I laugh a little, but I quickly turn away ,\\npushing the amusement down.\\nBut in a moment, he’s at my side, putting the A.1. and Heinz sauce on\\nthe rack on the door .\\nHe stares down at me, and my stomach dips.\\n“You have a pretty smile, cuz,” he tells me. “If you stay, I’ll make you\\nsmile some more.”\\nOh, geez. Isn’ t he charming?\\nIgnoring him, I finish reloading everything, not even caring that nothing\\nis organized. He laughs under his breath and helps me—both of us getting\\nthe job done in a few minutes.\\nJake walks in and heads for the fridge, and I move out of the way,\\nletting him in.\\nI gather the tools I used and start to walk away to put them back in the\\nshop where I found them, but I hear my uncle’ s gruf f voice.\\n“Where’ s the sausage?” he asks.\\nI turn toward him, seeing him sift through all the shelves, nothin g where\\nhe left it now .\\n“There was mold growing on it,” I tell him.\\nI threw it away , along with a few other things.\\nBut he just looks at me, and I steel my spine. “It can be cut off,” he\\nsays.\\nCut of f?\\nGross. There are levels of decay. The mold just makes it easier to see\\nthe really bad parts.\\n“You don’ t waste any time, do you?” he gripes, moving things out of the\\nway, appearing to look for something else. “Everything’ s rearranged.”\\n“Dad—”\\nNoah tries to step in, but his father just stands up straight and looks at\\nhis son.\\n“And where the hell did you go?” Jake asks.\\nHe had left earlier . Was he not supposed to?\\nBut Noah’ s jaw just tenses, and instead of answering, he shakes his head\\nand leaves. I don’t know if I envy Noah or what. He doesn’ t get along with\\nhis father , either , but at least he has his attention.\\nI drop my eyes and tap the iPad screen, closing out YouTube and the\\nrefrigerator repair video I used. “Look,” Jake says, turned towa rd me and his voice lower now. “Don’ t\\ngo above and beyond, okay? We run a well-oiled machine here, so just do\\nwhat I ask. Reor ganizing the refrigerator or cabinets or decorating—\\nanything like that—is not necessary . Or really appreciated, to be honest. If\\nyou need ideas for chores, I can give you plenty .”\\nI nod.\\nAnd I set the tools on the counter and leave the kitchen.\\n \\n \\nThat night—hou rs into a thunderstorm that had been raging since after\\ndinner—I snap awake, every muscle in my body tight and hot. I clench the\\nsheets at my side, my chest rising and falling with rapid breaths, and sweat\\ndripping down my neck.\\nI gasp, trying to breathe, but I can’t fucking move. I try to swallow , but\\nit takes four times before I’m able to wet my dry throat.\\nI roll my eyes around the room, fear lingering in my brain, but I’m not\\nsure why as I take inventory of my surroundings.\\nThe room is dark, the storm still rocking against my windows, and I\\nhear the drops pummel the deck outside my room.\\nSlowly , I stretch out my fingers , prying my hands off the sheets, and I\\nsit up, wincing at the ache in my shoulders and neck from being locked up\\ntoo long.\\nDid I dr eam?  I close my eyes, the tears I don’ t remember crying seeping\\nout and joining the ones already wetting my face.\\nI don’t remember anything, but I must’ve been crying or screaming,\\nbecause my throat is burning and my knuckles ache from clenching my\\nfists. I quickly glance at my door, relieved to see it’s still closed. Thank God\\nI wasn’ t loud enough to wake anyone.\\nI throw off the covers and walk  to the chest of drawers to retrieve my\\nphone.\\nWhen I was a kid, I had terrib le episodes of screaming and crying—\\nabsolute midnight mania—where I’d wake up and carry on, but I was\\ncompletely aslee p. They said it was night terrors, and when it was over—\\nwhen Mirai or whatever nanny soothed me back to the sleep—I never\\nremembered anything. I only knew it happened, because my muscles would be drain ed, my throat would be dry, and I’d wake up with my eyes burning\\nfrom the tears.\\nI pick up my phone and turn it on.\\n1:15 a.m. Tears prick my throat, but I push them down.\\nIt was always somewhere aroun d 1:15 a.m. my parents had said. Some\\nkind of internal clock thing.\\nBut my night terrors ended. I haven’ t had one since…fourth grade,\\nmaybe?\\nI drop my phone back onto the dresser , propping my elbows on top and\\nholding my head in my hands.\\nI’m an adult. I’m alone.\\nI glance at the door again. I don’t want them to hear me screaming like\\nsome nutcase.\\nI finally notice a sting on my arm and look down to see three, red half-\\nmoons on my forearm, and I instantly know what they are, the memory\\ncoming back like it was yesterday .\\nI’d clawed myself in my sleep.\\nThe bag of candy still sits on my dresser , and I shoot out my arm,\\nswiping the bag off the dresser and into the garbage can off to the side.\\nWhat the hell was I doing in my sleep? How could I not wake up? What\\nhappens if I’m alone in L.A. or when I go off to college, and I have to have\\na roommate?\\nI shouldn’ t be alone.\\nBut I’m not sure I should stay here with them. My parents’ death could\\nbe triggering it.\\nOr it could be something else.  \\n \\n \\nJ a k e\\n \\nShe shouldn’ t be here. This is a mistake.\\nI can’t do Tiernan any good. I can barely keep my own kids under\\ncontrol. Noah is ten seconds from packing a bag and leaving any day, and\\nKaleb…\\nJesus, Kaleb... I’ve never been able to imagine that kid’s future, because\\nmen like him don’ t live long. He makes too many enemies.\\nI throw off the covers, having a shitty night’ s sleep despite all the space\\nI had in bed without Jules there.\\nI need to start locking the doors at night. I mean, what guy doesn’ t want\\nto wake up at two a.m. to a twenty-three-year -old, naked redhead on top of\\nhim, but she’ s making a habit of it.\\nAnd the sex isn’ t very good.\\nI rub my hands over my face. I don’t know . Maybe it is good, and I’m\\njust bored. I can’ t talk to her . Or the three who came before her .\\nI certainly don’t have any busin ess having another responsibility under\\nmy roof right now .\\nOr ever. I’m a terrible father , and I’m too old for more surprises like a\\nteenage girl living in my house. Hannes could go fuck himself wherever he\\nwas in hell.\\nSitting up, I throw my legs over the side of the bed and stand up,\\ngrabbing my jeans of f the chair .\\nThat son-of-a-bitch.  I hadn’ t spoken to my step-brother , or anyone in\\nthat family for over twenty years, but I’m worth a mention in his will? Was there really no one else who knew her and would’ve gladly taken her?\\nBut no, I called her up that night, heard something in her voice that\\ngrabbed hold of me, and I spoke before I had a chance to think.\\nThe kid has problems.\\nOf cours e, that makes her no different than my own kids, but Hannes\\nand Amelia fucked her up. She’s so different than I thought she’d be. Quiet,\\nrigid, afraid. I have no idea how to handle her. I’m not smart  enough for\\nthis. People like her, who don’t show emotion are finding other ways to\\nrelease it.\\nSo, what is it with her? Drugs? Alcohol? Cutting?\\nSex?\\nI stop, an image of Tiernan in the backseat of some car—swea t on her\\nface, hair sticking to her cheek,  eyes closed, breathing hard—pops into my\\nhead.\\nI let out a breath and yank my T-shirt off the chair , tucking it into my\\nback pocket for later. She better not. I’m not supplying this town with new\\npussy . I cock my neck side to side, hearing it crack a couple of times.\\nHannes and Amelia should never have had a kid. I never understood\\nwhat her parents saw in each other , but shit sticks together , I guess. The best\\nthing that could ’ve happened to Tiernan was to lose them, and I’m only\\nsorry it didn’ t happen sooner .\\nI walk to my bedroom door , open it, and cross the hall to her room.\\nI knock. “T iernan.”\\nIt’s only just after five, and I rub the sore muscles on my neck. I don’t\\nwant to wake her up, but I didn’ t get a chance to apologize yesterday\\nbecause she stayed in her room the rest of the damn day .\\nBut I’m not letting her hide in here just because I was an asshole.\\nWhen there’ s no answer , I knock again. “T iernan?”\\nThe house is silent other than the faint music Noah sleeps to drifting out\\nfrom underneath his bedroom door .\\nHesitantly , I crack open her door, slowly in case she freaks out, and\\npeek my head inside.\\n“Tiernan, it’ s Jake,” I say in a low voice.\\nHer smell hits me, and I pause.\\nIt smells like…\\nLike skin, wet from the rain. Déjà vu suddenly washes over me, and I\\ninhale deeper . Skin with the faintest hint of fragrance. Like that soft, hidden place behind a woman’ s ear that smells like her but also a little of her\\nperfume and shampoo and sweat.\\nAnd suddenly I can taste it. It used to be my favorite place to kiss her .\\nGod, I’d for gotten.\\nI clear my throa t, straightening my spine. “Tiernan,” I call, but it comes\\nout as a bark. Not sure why I’m aggravated now .\\nI take a step into the room, but as the bed comes into view , I see it’s\\nalready made, and she’s definit ely not in it. My heart skips a beat, and I\\nopen the door wide, looking around her bedroom.\\nShe wouldn’ t have left…\\nThe lights are off, but the dim morning light pours through her balcony\\ndoors, and I see the room is just as neat as when she arrived, although a few\\nthings have been  moved. Her personal items sit on the top of her desk and\\nher dresser , and I see a pair of flip flops by the bed stand.\\nOkay , she didn’ t leave, then. Not sure how she could anyway— remote\\nas we are—but I wouldn’ t put it past her to try .\\nLeaving the room, I close the door behind me and give Noah’ s door two\\nhard pounds as I pass by and head down the stairs. He needs to get his ass\\nup, too, and the fact that I still need to be my twenty-year -old kid’s alarm\\nclock is ridiculous.\\nAs soon as I hit the living room , though, I smell coffee and know I’m\\nnot the only one up. Tiernan works at something on the table, and I glance\\nover, trying to see what she’ s doing as I walk to the cof fee pot.\\nHer hair is piled into a messy bun on the top of her head as she appears\\nto glue pieces of something together .\\nI pour a cup of coffee, swallowing hard. “Thank you for fixing the\\nfridge,” I say , not looking at her .\\nI felt like an ass yesterday when Noah told me that everythin g in the\\nfridge was out of its usual order because she had to empty it to fix it.\\nA huge ass.\\nAnd after the surprise wore off, I was impressed. So much of the world\\nsimply replaces broken things or hires out to have it fixed, not wanting to\\ntrouble themselves to learn things on their own. Even with the plethora of\\nhelp there is on the Internet.\\nShe’s self-suf ficient.\\nWhen she still hasn’ t responded, I turn around, taking a drink from my\\nmug as I slowly approach. She pieces together a plate that appears to have broken, gluing each\\npiece carefully together .\\nIt’s one of our green ones. The corner of my mouth turns up in a small\\nsmile.\\nShe really didn’ t have to bother . It’s a cheap plate, and they’re easy to\\nbreak.\\nI shoot my eyes up to her face again—her gaze focused, lips closed, and\\nher breathing even and controlled like I’m not standing right here.\\n“Tiernan?” I say again.\\nBut she still doesn’ t respond. Jesus, it’s like talking to my kids. Are all\\nteenagers like this?\\nPutting the last piece in place, she holds it for a few moments and then\\ntakes a paper towel to clean up any bubbled glue.\\n“Is there anything I can help with today?” she suddenly asks, finally\\nglancing up at me.\\nHuh?\\nShe looks up at me, stray strand s of hair falling around her face and in\\nher eyes, and again, I’m taken off guard. I’d braced myself for a\\nconfrontation after the way I’d acted yesterday , but… she’s ready to move\\non. Should I push a conversation or let it alone?\\nI run my hand over my scalp. Whatever . If she’s going to make this easy\\nfor me, I won’ t complain.\\n“Yeah,” I say , letting out a sigh of relief.\\nShe rises from her chair , standin g up right in front of me, but her eyes\\nimmediately land on my chest, and she quickly looks away .\\nI tighten my lips and pull my T-shirt out of my back pocket to slip it on.\\nHannes—who was born wearing a suit—and Brynmor—an education that’s\\ncomprised of same-sex classmates, I guess she’s not used to this. She’ll get\\nher feet wet here, though.\\n“Where do you need me?” she asks, looking ready to be anyw here but\\nthe kitchen.\\nI hide my smile . “I have to…um , milk Bernadette,” I tell her as I turn\\naround to grab a cup of cof fee.\\nHer gaze falters.\\n“The cow,” I explain. “The horses need to be fed, and the stalls  need to\\nbe cleared. Noah will show you how it’ s done.”\\n“And then?” And then?\\nI grip my mug, leaning against the counter . “We have work in the shop\\nto get to, so if you want to do breakfast…that’d be a big help.”\\nI should’ve asked nicer yesterday .\\nShe simply nods.\\nI start to walk past her but stop and look down at her. “The bacon\\nexactly like you did it yesterday ,” I say . “Got it?”\\nShe keeps her eyes planted on the floor for another moment, but then\\nshe looks up and meets my eyes. “Got it.”\\nI stare down at her .\\nI wish she’d smile. I don’t expect it, given what’ s happened to her, but I\\nhave a feeling she doesn’ t smile a lot regardless.\\nShe is pretty , though. I’d give her parents that much. Flawless skin that\\nlooks almost porcelain. High cheek bones, the hollows rosy. Eyebrows a\\nlittle darker than her hair, framing long lashes and Amelia’ s stormy gray\\neyes, more pierc ing than her mother ’s because she has the same dark ring\\naround the iris that her father had.\\nShe’s more her mother , though. The slender neck, the curve of the waist,\\nthe spine and shoulders that made her seem statuesque sometimes. On\\nAmelia, it looked cold. On Tiernan, it… makes you wonder how she’d bend\\nand move in someone’ s arms.\\nSomeone’ s.\\nMy body warms, and I hold her gaze for a moment. Amelia and Hannes.\\nAmusement tugs at the corners of my mouth, but I don’ t let it show .\\nI don’ t need her to stay . It’s no skin of f my nose if she leaves.\\nBut I can forbid her from leaving if I want to.\\nIf for no other reason than to burn off my exceeding supply of\\nfrustration with her father . To make her work of f his debt to me.\\nTo fuck up her life just a little bit.\\nTo make her…\\nShe wets her pink lips, and my breath catches for a moment.\\nIf I wer e a worse man...\\nSetting down my mug, I head to the closet and pull my Rockies cap off\\nthe coat rack, fitting it on my head. I need to get out of here. I’m not sure\\nwhere the hell my mind is going, but it’s not right. She’s my responsibility .\\nNot my opportu nity for payback. Not to mention, she’s quiet, boring, and a\\nlittle pathetic. I can’ t torture someone who won’ t fight back. A moment later, I hear Noah’ s footfalls on the stairs and watch him\\nhead for the coffee pot with his T-shirt slung over his shoulder and no shoes\\nor socks on.\\n“We’ve got a lot to do today ,” I warn him, knowing it takes him at least\\ntwenty minutes to get out the door after he wakes up.\\nI have two sons and neither one of them is entirely present. Kaleb was\\neasier . When he was here. And Noah was always here but never easy .\\n“Show T iernan how to do the stalls and feed the horses.”\\nHe nods without looking at me as a yawn stretches across his face.\\nI pull on my boots and head back into the kitchen, transferring my\\ncoffee into a travel mug to take outside with me.\\nI hear Noah’ s voice. “Do you have an undershirt on?”\\nI look over at him and Tiernan, seeing her nod. She wears jeans and a\\npeasant blouse, not really dressy , but it’ s white.\\n“Take of f your shirt then,” he says, taking a drink.\\nShe pinches her eyebrows at him.\\n“I’m giving you a new one,” he explains, tossing the flannel over his\\nshoulder onto the back of a chair . “And kick of f your shoes.”\\nHe head s across  the kitchen, opening the shop door and reaching inside.\\nHe pulls in a pair of his old muddy , rain boots from when he was thirteen or\\nso and tosses them across the floor at her .\\nIt’s a good idea. She won’ t want her expensive clothes ruined.\\nI dart my eyes to her, expectin g her to look uncertain, but she only\\nhesitates a moment before slowly starting to unbutton her blouse.\\nI clear my throat again and look away . She should be doing that in the\\nprivacy of the bathroom.\\nOut of the corner of my eye, I see her pull off the shirt and fold it over\\nthe back of a chair . She has something else white on underneath, and I see\\nNoah approach her, but I keep my eyes averted as I grab an apple to take\\noutside with me.\\nAn invis ible hook keeps tugging at my chin—pulling at me to look at\\nher—but I just blink a few times and charge out of the room, biting hard\\ninto the apple.\\nThis is bullshit.\\n \\n  An hour later, I’m pulling up to the stables in an ATV loaded  with a few\\nbales of hay when my phone rings.\\nPulling it out, I look at the number and see it’s the same area code as\\nTiernan’ s.\\n“Hello?” I answer . I don’t want any crap, but it could be her parents’\\nlawyer calling, so…\\n“Hi, Mr. Van der Berg?” a woman with a slight accent says. “I’m Mirai\\nPatel. Mrs. de Haas’ s assistant.”\\nI hold the phon e to my ear, pulling on my work gloves. “How  does a\\ndead woman still have an assistant?”\\nBut she doesn’ t respond, and I almost smile, because I’ve succeeded at\\nbeing insensitive.\\n“What do you want?” I ask, hauling a bale into my hands and stacking it\\nnext to the stable. “T iernan has a phone if you want to talk to her .”\\n“I wanted to talk to you, actually .”\\nFor Christ’ s sake, why?\\nMs. Patel is silent for a moment and then inquires, “How is she?”\\nHow is she? That’ s why you’re calling me?\\n“She’ s fine,” I grunt, pulling another brick of hay up of f the A TV.\\nShe’s quiet again, and after a few more moments, I take the phone in my\\nhand, about ready to hang up. I don’ t have time for this.\\n“Look, I don’t know how to say this in a way that isn’t completely\\nawkward,” she finally tells me, “so I’m just going to say it.”\\nGood. I glance through the doorway of the stable, seeing Noah and\\nTiernan’ s heads over the top of a stall as they churn the hay .\\n“I’d like her to come home,” Patel says.\\nTiernan can leave whenever she wants. I didn’ t make her come here.\\nBut at the same time, who is this woman to tell me what to do with my\\nniece?\\nMirai Patel goes on, “I can’t make her, and she’ll probably be angry I’m\\ntalking to you, but…”\\n“But?”\\n“I’m worried about her,” she finally states. “Tiernan doesn’ t talk about\\nthings, and her parents passing away like they did won’ t allow her the\\nopportunity to resolve any of her issues with them. I want to be there for\\nher. I’m worried everything building up inside of her will eventually spill\\nover.” “Spill over?”\\nWho is this woman? What arrogance to think I can’t handle this? I\\nmean, I can’ t, but she doesn’ t know that.\\n“I’m sure you’ve noticed that she’ s quiet,” Patel tells me.\\nAnd? If a quiet kid is all I’m dealing with, then maybe I do have all the\\nexperience necessary to handle this.\\n“And you think you can raise her better?” I ask.\\n“I think you don’ t know her . I do.”\\nI squeeze my fist around the phone.\\nA strang er I’ve never met or heard of until today lays claim to my\\nbrother ’s child and she thought this conversation was going to go well?\\n“And I think if I turn over guardianship of Tiernan to you,” I say, “that\\nputs you in charge of not only her emotional support, but her finances, as\\nwell. Am I right, Ms. Patel?”\\nShe falls silent, and I smile to myself. Why else would someone who\\nhas no obligation to an underage  orphan want that responsibility unless that\\nunderage orphan is loaded?\\nBut then she speaks up, her tone firm. “I’ve had access to her finances\\nsince I started working for her parents ten years ago,” she says. “I can be\\ntrusted. Can you?”\\nI narrow my eyes.\\n“Just think of what all those millions will do for your business, Mr. Van\\nder Ber g,” she says.\\nAnd I clench my teeth so goddamn hard an ache flashes through my jaw\\nlike lightning. Is that what she thinks? I would sooner flush that money\\ndown the fucking toilet.\\n“Her place…” I finally grit out, “is with her family .”\\n“Her place is with someone who loves her .”\\n“This conversation is over .”\\nAnd I start to pull the phone away from my ear .\\nBut then I hear her voice again and stop. “She used to wake up every\\nnight around one in the morning ,” Patel says. “Like clockwork and without\\nan alarm. Did you know that, Mr . Van der Ber g?”\\nI remain silent, unsure if she’s telling the truth and hating that she\\nknows something I don’ t, if it is.\\n“Do you know why?” she taunts further . I glance into the stable at Tiernan, watching her hop out of one of the\\nstalls with her arm covering her nose and mouth as she dry heaves at the\\nsmell. Noah pats her on the back, silently laughing behind her, but then she\\nswats at him, and he just laughs harder .\\n“You would think ‘her family’ would know that about her,” Patel mocks\\nme. “Goodbye, Mr . Van der Ber g.”\\nAnd then the line is dead.\\nI stare at my screen for a mom ent and then back at Tiernan. She and\\nNoah are bantering back and forth, a big ass grin on his face and keeping\\nthe rake from her as she tries to take it back. Finally , she grabs hold of it\\nand marches back into the stall.\\nI smile to myse lf. She’s stronger than that woman gives her credit for.\\nMirai Patel may care about Tiernan, but she’s had her for ten years. What\\ngood did it do the kid? That woman had her chance.\\nPulling a cloth out of my back pocket, I head into the stable, shaking out\\nthe square and matching two corners to make a triangle. Finding Tiernan in\\na stall, I see her bent over, shuffling the hay with her ponytail sticking out\\nthe back of one of Noah’ s caps.\\n“Hey .” I touch her back.\\nShe jerks up and spins around, bumping into my chest.\\nI hold up the cloth, gesturing toward her face.\\n“It’s clean,” I tell her . “It’ll help with the smell.”\\nI move to tie it around her nose and mouth, but she shakes her head.\\n“I’m okay .”\\nI laugh under my breath, expecting as much. “Why are you so\\nstubborn?”\\nAnd I move around her, tying it at the back of her head before she has a\\nchance to fight me more.\\nComing around the front, I only see her eyes peering out from under the\\ncap and the rest covered with the handkerchief.\\nShe looks like a bank robber , and I almost snort, but she doesn’t look\\nhappy right now , so I keep the joke to myself.\\n“You don’t have  to be so tough,” I tease, knocking the bill of her cap.\\n“It fuckin’ stinks in here. Y ou’ll get used to it, though.”\\nBut instead of saying ‘thank you’, she simply turns back around and\\ncontinues working. I stand there a moment, my muscles tight with slight frustration. I’m\\nsure you’ve noticed that she’ s quiet.\\nYeah, lady, she’s quiet. Slowly , I turn to leave, but I glance over my\\nshoulder at her once again.\\nBut when I do, she’ s staring at me. She’ s stopped raking.\\nHer eyes, dark under the shadow of the cap, make my heart skip a beat,\\nand I pause.\\nBut quickly , as if it was nothing , she puts her head back down and starts\\nworking again. I stand there, watching her .\\nEverything building up inside of her will eventually spill over , Mirai had\\nsaid.\\nI turn my lips up in a slight smile. Maybe that’s exactly what the kid\\nneeds.\\n \\n \\n“Finished already?” I ask when Noah and T iernan head over to me.\\nI stand in the truck bed, pushing the broom and the last remnants of hay,\\ndirt, and shit I’ve had to haul this week.\\n“Don’ t worry ,” Noah chides. “We did it right. She’s on a mission,\\nthough.”\\n“Do you have more?” Tiernan looks up at me expectantly with my\\nhandkerchief around her neck.\\nMore?\\nShe breathes hard, and I pull out my phone, checking the time. They got\\ndone with that a lot sooner than when it’ s just Noah and Kaleb.\\nI stick my phone back in my pocket. “Take the clothes off the line,” I\\ntell her. “And I need fresh, soapy water . Hot.” And then I look at her. “And\\nthen breakfast.”\\nShe nods and spins around, hurrying back to the house.\\nNoah looks after her. “I rememb er when I was new to chores,” he says\\nwistfully . “It was kind of fun. For a few minutes.”\\nI shake my head. I don’ t think T iernan finds this fun.\\n“If we train her up, it’ll be like I’m not even gone,” he tells me.\\nI shoot him a look, but I don’t stop as I shove another pile of debris out\\nof the back of the truck. “Don’ t piss me of f today ,” I warn him.\\nHe’s not leaving, and T iernan isn’ t here to take his workload. I can see him looking at me out of the corner of my eye, wanting this\\nconversation, but I won’ t do it. We’ve had this talk, and I’m done. He’s not\\ngoing away . He’s twenty-fucking-years old. He doesn’ t know what he\\nwants. Or what he needs.\\nMaking a mistake takes seconds . Living with them takes a lifetime, and\\nI don’ t want my sons to suf fer like that.\\nBefore he can try to fight me again, I hop down from the truck and head\\nfor the house to get my own soapy water .  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\n“Is it okay if I take a truck to town and do some food shopping? ” I sit at the\\nbreakfast table, toying with the burnt bacon in my hand and feeling it\\ncrumble onto the plate like a potato chip. “I can pick up anything you might\\nneed, too, while I’m out.”\\nJake looks up at me, chewing his food, and I zone in right between his\\neyes—focusing—to get my mind off the fact that his stupid shirt is off\\nagain. I mean, seriously . Do these men ever get completely dressed?\\nWomen survive with the heat and sweat all the time without discarding our\\nclothing.\\n“What do you need to eat other than bacon?” he questions.\\nBut I keep my expression even, not indulging his joke.\\nHe finally laughs. “Of course, you can take the truck.”\\nReaching into his back pocket, he opens his wallet and pulls out some\\ncash, tossing it into the middle of the table while Noah downs the rest of his\\nmilk.\\n“I have money ,” I insist. I can contribute to my own expenses.\\nBut he just argues back. “So do I,” he says. “We don’t need de Haas\\nmoney in this house.”\\nde Haas money .\\nHe slips his wallet back into his pocket, and I glance down  at the\\nhundred bucks he dropped on the table—far more than I actually need.\\nBut I think he knows that. He just wants me to see that he can\\naccommodate my lofty standar ds as much as his brother could. Unfortunately , I can’t stop myse lf. “You won’ t take de Haas money , but\\nyou’ll take a de Haas.”\\nAnd I raise my eyes again, locking gazes with him. If he resents my\\nparents’ money in this house, then surely he resents me in this house, too.\\n“You’re ours,” he states plainly . “We pay for what you need.”\\nI stare at him another moment, and then Noah reaches into the middle of\\nthe table, snatching up the cash.\\n“I’ll go with her . I need some shit.”\\nWe both get up, clearing our plates and loading the dishwasher .\\n“Toss the plastic bags into the barrel when you unpack groceries,” Jake\\ntells us, still eating at the table. “I’m burning trash this afternoon.”\\nI stop and glare at the back of his head. “Burning trash?” I repeat,\\nsearching for an argument he’ll listen to. “Please…don’ t. It’s bad for you,\\nbreathing it in, and it’s really bad for the planet.” I circle the table to face\\nhim. “It’ s illegal for a reason.”\\nBurning leaves is one thing. But plastic and…\\nHis fork clangs on the plate, and he picks his cup of cof fee up. “Garbage\\ntrucks don’ t get up here, sweetheart.”\\n“We’ll figure it out,” I retort. “You can’t burn plastic or inked paper or\\n—”\\n“California girls are environm entally conscious, aren’ t they? ” Noah\\nlaughs from the sink. “No plasti c straws. You have to bring your own bags\\nto the supermar ket. I hear they only flush the toilet every other time they\\ngo, too.”\\nI dig in my eyebrows so deep it hurts. “Yeah, sometimes we’ll even\\nshower together to conserve water . It’s awesome.”\\nI hear Jake snort, and I drop my eyes again, arching an eyebrow at\\nmyself. Not sure where my newfound sarcasm came from, but I harden my\\njaw, not allowing myself to enjoy it.\\nI turn to leave, but I stop and glare at Jake again. “And that de Haas\\nmoney is hard-earned,” I say. “My parents made contributions to the world.\\nPeople value what they did whether you liked them or not. Whether I liked\\nthem or not.”\\nI blink at the words coming out of my mouth, surprising myself. But\\nwhile I had my problems with my parents, I realize for the first time that\\nI’m a little protective of their legacy .\\n“The world will remember them,” I point out. “And so will I.” Jake leans back in his chair , regarding me with an\\namused look. “Especially with you around.”\\nI hesitate, his words unnerving me for some reason. The sense of\\npermanence in his tone. Like I’m here to stay .\\n“I might not stick around,” I suddenly blurt out.\\nBut then I imme diately regret it. He took me in when he didn’ t have to.\\nAnd I came here willingly . I should be more grateful.\\nBut…he did threaten to keep me here against my will yesterday , too.\\n“You’re kind of a prick sometimes,” I tell him.\\nNoah jerks his head in our direction, his eyes wide as his gaze darts\\nfrom me to his father .\\nBut Jake makes  no move, just sitting there and looking at me with the\\nsame amusement on his face.\\n“I’m a teddy bear, Tiernan.” He stands up, his fingers threaded through\\nthe handle of his cof fee cup. “Y ou still haven’ t met Kaleb yet.”\\nI hear Noah laugh behind him, both of them in on some joke I clearly\\ndon’t understand. I twist around, heading up to my room to clean up.\\n“Put on a proper shirt before you go out!” Jake yells after me.\\nI snarl to myself, stomping a little harder on the stairs than I mean to.\\nI make your food . It’s really not smart to provoke me.\\n \\n \\nI shower quickly , getting the sticky heat off me, as well as the dirt and smell\\nfrom the barn. I’m pretty sure I’ll have to shower again later, just so I can\\nwash my hair . I don’ t have time right now , though.\\nRunning a brush through my hair, I slip on the same baseball cap Noah\\nloaned me this morning and rush out of the room with my little crossbody\\npurse and wearing a fresh pair of jeans and a T -shirt.\\nJake is actually pretty stocked on food, especially fresh stuff, but in the\\nrush to come here, I’d for gotten to arrange for a few…other things I’d need.\\nWhen I walk outside, Noah is already waiting for me. He sits on a dirt\\nbike with a helmet on his head and another one in his hand.\\nI hesitat e for a moment, glancin g at the truck behind his bike. Are we\\ndriving separately or…?\\n“What are you doing?” I ask, stepping down the wide wooden steps.\\n“Taking us to town.” He holds the spare helmet out to me, and I look down at it and then back\\nup to him, seeing wisps of his blond hair hanging over his forehead under\\nthe helmet.\\nI raise my eyebrows. We’re taking the bike to town? “Where are the\\ngroceries supposed to go?” I ask him.\\nBut he just laughs under his breath, turns on the bike, and twists the\\nhandle, revving the engine. “Climb on. I don’t bite,” he tells me. And then\\nhe shoots me a mischievous look. “My little cousins, anyway .”\\nI almost roll my eyes. Taking the helmet, I fix it over my baseball cap,\\nbut the front knocks the bill of the hat, making the fit unco mfortable. I\\nfumble for a moment, finally pulling of f the helmet again and then the hat.\\nBut Noah takes my arms, stopping me. “Like this,” he says. And he\\ntakes the hat, fits it backward onto my head, and then plops the helmet\\ndown over it, the bill now resting at the back of my skull.\\nOh.\\nI’d rather have the cap in town, since my hair is in shambles right now,\\nso this works.\\nHe fastens the strap under my chin, and I try to avert my eyes, but he\\nhas this lazy half-smile on his lips that kind of makes my body hum. And\\nblue eyes behin d black lashes with the sides of his gray T-shirt cut out to\\nshow off golden, muscular arms, and he wears persistently scruffy jeans,\\nbecause he never has to try too hard to impress anyone.\\nI’m jealous. He doesn’ t have a plan in the world.\\nIt might’ve been a little nice to have cousins growing up. Maybe it\\nwould’ve been fun if I’d spent my summers here, growing up in the sun and\\nthe banter and the dirt with him.\\nHe makes me less nervous than Jake, too.\\nHis eyes meet mine, and I look away , taking over and forcing his hands\\naway as I finish tightening the strap.\\n“You ever been on a motorcycle?” he asks.\\n“No.” I climb on behind him, situating my purse to my side as it hangs\\nacross my body .\\n“I’m gentle,” he assures me. “Ask any girl.”\\n“I’m not any girl,” I say, sliding my arms around him and locking my\\nhands in front. “You hurt me, and you still have to go home with me and\\ndeal with me.”\\n“Good point.” He snaps the visor on his own helmet down and takes off, making my\\nbreath catch in my throat.\\nJesus . I instin ctively tighten my hold and clench my thighs around him\\nas my stomach drops into my feet. The bike wobbles more than a truck, and\\nI dart my eyes side to side, tryin g to keep my balance, but he’s not slowing\\ndown, and all I can really do is hold on. He might know what he’s doing,\\nbut this is new to me. I blink long and hard and then simply look down,\\nkeeping my eyes of f the road.\\nThese hills were a little steep coming up in the truck with Jake. I don’t\\nthink I need to see us going down on a dirt bike. Is this even street legal?\\nI hold him close, just staring at his T-shirt, so I won’ t look at anything\\nelse, but after a moment, I try to loosen my grip on him a little. I’m\\nplastered to his back. I’m probably making him uncomfortable.\\nBut he takes one hand off a handle and pulls my arms tighter  around\\nhim again, forcing my chest into his back.\\nHe turns his head, raising his visor . “Hold on!” he shouts.\\nFine.  I refasten my hands around him.\\nWe ride all the way down the gravel drive and come to the paved road,\\nturning left and heading back the same way I came up two days ago, gravity\\nforcing my body into Noah’ s the entire time.\\nOnce we’re on blacktop, and the terrain is a little more even, I raise my\\neyes and take in the trees on both sides, as well as the dense wooded areas\\nsurrounding us. Slopes, cliffs, and rockfalls, I’m seeing the land around us a\\nlot more clearly than when I came up in the dark the day before yesterday .\\nJake isn’t lying. Even with all the trees that will shed their leaves in the\\nwinter , there are lots of conifer s which will block visibility in the heavy\\nsnows. The land changes, gullies suddenly rising into steep cliffs, and the\\nsides of the road are decorated with sporadic piles of rocks that spilled from\\nuncertain land. It’s dangerous enough to be up here in good weather . The\\ncity won’ t pay for a truck to shovel snow and salt the roads for one family .\\nWhich—I’m guessing—is exactly how my uncle wants it. Does Noah\\nlike it that way?  His words from yesterday play back in my head. I would\\nleave. I would leave in a heartbeat. You’re here, and you don’t have to be. I\\nhave to be her e, but I don’ t want to be.\\nSo why does he stay? Jake can’ t make him. He’ s a legal adult.\\nWe twist and turn, winding down the road as it turns into a highway , and\\nit takes a good twenty minutes before we see the town come into view . A couple of steeples peek out from  the tops of the trees, and brick buildings\\nline streets shaded with abundant green maples that I know will be orange\\nand red come October .\\nWe come to our first stop sign, and he lifts up his visor now that we’re\\nslowing down.\\n“Do you have others?” I ask. “Cousins, I mean?”\\nI don’ t know why I care.\\nBut he just shakes his head. “No.” And then thinks better of it. “Well,\\nmaybe. I don’ t know .”\\nI’m it on his father ’s side, so that just leaves his mom. Where is she? I\\nhaven’ t known Jake long, but it’s hard picturing him domesticated. Were\\nthey married?\\nFor a moment, it’s easy to think well of him, raising two boys on his\\nown, but it’s also easy to unders tand how he could drive someone so far up\\nthe wall that she ran for the hills.\\nIt’s on the tip of my tongue to ask Noah about her, but if he tells me\\nsomething sad, like she’s dead or abandoned them at birth, I don’t know\\nhow to respond to things I can’t do anything about. My sympathy just\\ncomes of f disingenuous.\\nHe grips his handlebars, the veins in his forearms bulging out of his\\nskin, and I tighten my hold as he takes off again, entering the main drag of\\ntown with all the shops lining the street.\\nWe pull up to a store and park, Noah backing into a space and turning\\noff the bike.\\n“I’ll teach you to ride if you want,” Noah offers as we climb  off and\\nremove our helmets. “If you stay .”\\nI follow his lead, leaving my helmet on the other handlebar and turn my\\ncap back around, following him onto the sidewalk. “You barel y know me,\\nand I’m not friendly ,” I mumble. “Why do you want me to stay?”\\n“Because nothing changes up on the peak. Not ever .”\\nWhat does that mean?\\nI enter the store,  not responding, because I’m not sure what he’s talking\\nabout.\\n“Hey , Sheryl,” he calls out, and the lady at the counter smiles back at\\nhim as she hands a customer her bag.\\nI look around, seeing the store is really small. For crying out loud,\\nthere’ s like six aisles. They better have ramen. “Grab what you need,” Noah tells me. “I’ll meet you at the register .”\\nAnd he heads of f, disappearing down an aisle to the right.\\nI take a basket from the stack, thankful he’s headed in the opposite\\ndirection, and veer of f to the back, toward the pharmacy .\\nThe store is small, but it’s kind of cute. It has the turn-of-the-century\\nvibe with an old-fashioned regis ter and polished wood everywhere. I pass a\\nbar with an old soda fountain and a menu of sundaes and other treats, a\\ncouple of patrons sitting on stools and enjoying homemade milkshakes.\\nStopping at the counter in the back of the store, I quickly look around\\nfor Noah before I address the pharmacist.\\n“May I help you?” he says with a smile.\\n“Yes,” I say quietly . “I’d like to have a prescription transferred to here,\\nif possible. Do I just give you the phone number of my pharmacy back\\nhome?”\\n“Oh, yes.” He pulls a pen out of his white jacket and slides a pad of\\npaper over. “That’ s easy. I’ll just call your pharmacy . We can have it refilled\\nfor you today .”\\nCool.\\n“The number , please?”\\nI dictate the number , watching him write it down. “213-555-3100.”\\n“Your name?”\\n“Tiernan de Haas. Birthdate eleven—one—of oh one.”\\n“And what is the prescription for?” he asks.\\nI glance around for Noah again. “Um, it’s the only prescription I have\\nwith them.”\\nHe raise s his eyes, laughing a little. “I just need the name, so I know\\nwhat to confirm with them.”\\nI tap my foot. “T ri-Sprintec,” I answer quickly without moving my lips.\\nHe nods  as if he’s never had an overly nosy and playful cousin who\\nwould just love to know why I’m on birth control and why-ever would I\\nneed it, locked on a mountain all winter without access to men.\\nI watch him make the call, enter things on the computer , and finally\\nhang up.\\nHe looks over at me. “Give me ten minutes,” he says before he turns\\naround to head into the back.\\nI’m tempted to ask him to fill several months in advance, but I don’t\\nknow yet if I’m staying, so if I need more to get me through the winter , I’ll just come back. W ith the truck and without Noah next time.\\nHonestly , I don’t even need to be on the pill, much less on it all winter ,\\nbut it’s easier to stay on the routine I’ve been on since I was fourteen than\\nto stop and have to start again.\\nI move through the store, findin g a few things on my list here and there.\\nSome snacks I like, more sunsc reen, the multi-vitamins I forgot, and some\\ncandles. I grab a spare set of ear buds, some pens and paper , and I find the\\nramen in the last aisle. It’ s the cheap forty-seven-cent stuf f, but I want it.\\n“Hey ,” a female voice says behind me.\\nI turn, seeing a woman about my age staring at me.\\n“Hi,” I say back. But I retreat a step, because she’ s close.\\nShe’s in tight jeans, work boots, and has long, dark hair hangin g down\\nin loose  curls. Her hands are tucked into a fitted camo sweatshirt, and her\\nfull red lips are slightly pursed.\\n“Nice hat,” she says.\\nIs it? I don’t think I even read what it said before Noah gave it to me,\\nand I put it on. It’ s not new , though.\\n“Thank you.”\\nHer red lips are tight and her eyes narrow on me. Does she know me? I\\nhaven’ t met anyone yet.\\nI continue around her , moving down the aisle.\\n“Are you one of the racers’ girlfriends?” she inquires, following  me as I\\nwalk.\\nI glance at her as I pick up a loofah and some body wash. Racers’\\ngirlfriends?\\nOh, right. There’ s a Motocross scene up here. Not sure why she would\\nthink that has anything to do with me.\\n“No. Sorry .”\\nI continue down the aisle, but she keeps trailing me.\\n“Then where did you get that hat?”\\nMy hat… I stop and turn my head toward her, opening my mouth to\\nanswer , but then I close it again. Have I done something wrong? Who is\\nshe?\\n“If you’re not with Motocross,” she asks again, “then how’d you get\\nthat swag?”\\n“Someone gave  it to me.” I reply tightly and move up to the register ,\\ngrabbing a bag of cof fee beans on my way . “Is there a problem?” “Just askin’,” she replies. “Y ou don’ t live here, do you?”\\nI almost snort. She sounds so hopeful.\\nI keep my mouth  shut, though. I’m not sure if this is a small-town thing,\\nbut where I’m from we don’t dole out personal information just because\\nsomeone is an uncontrollable, nosy-parker . She might think I’m rude, but in\\nL.A., we call it “not getting robbed, raped, or killed.”\\n“She does live here, actually ,” Noah answers her, coming up to my side.\\n“She lives with us.”\\nAnd then he dumps an armful of crap onto the counter and puts his arm\\naround me, grinning at the woman like he’ s rubbing something in.\\nWhat’ s going on?\\nBut something catches my attention, and I drop my gaze to the pile of\\nstuff he’s buying. I narrow my eyes as I count. One, two, three…\\nEight boxes of condoms. Eight.\\nI shoot him a look, cocking an eyebrow . “You sure you don’t need the\\neconomy size they sell online?”\\n“Can I get it by tonight?” he retorts, looking down at me.\\nI roll my eyes, but I kind of feel like I want to smile or…laugh, because\\nhe’s such an idiot.\\nBut I hold it back.\\nI look away , because I can’t respond with anything witty , and he just\\nlaughs, his demeanor cooling when he focuses his attention back on the\\nwoman.\\n“Step of f,” he warns her .\\nShe looks between him and me, and finally walks out as Sheryl starts to\\nring up our groceries. I pull a couple reusable grocery bags off the nearby\\nrack and drop them on the counter , too.\\nI guess I was right. She was being rude, because Noah seeme d out of\\npatience with her on arrival.\\n“Cici Diggins,” he tells me, taking out the cash his father put on the\\ntable. “Gets real insecure when something prettier comes into town.”\\nMeaning me?\\n“She won’ t be happy about you living with us,” Noah adds.\\n“Why?”\\n“You’ll find out.” He laughs and takes the grocery bags. “I’m going to\\nhave too much fun watching this play out.”\\nWatching what play out? I frown. I don’ t like drama. I let Noah carry the stuff outsid e as I run back to the pharmacy to pick\\nup my prescription. I toss out the bag and slip the credit card-like pill\\npackage into my back pocket as I leave the store.\\nAs I approach the bike, I see a huge backpack secured in front of the\\nhandlebars, and I let out a breath, relieved I wouldn’ t have to try to carry\\nthis stuf f and hold onto him on the ride home.\\nI flip my hat backward again and pick up my helmet, seein g Noah\\nstaring across the street with his helmet still in his hand. A slight smirk\\nplays on his lips.\\nI follow his gaze.\\nSome guy—the same guy, I think, that came to the house with the group\\nof bikers yesterday—sits at a table at a café with a bunch of others, he and\\nNoah locked in a stare.\\nI thought he might be Kaleb, but he doesn’ t look like he grew up\\nmilking cows and cleaning horse stalls. The guy is dressed in the kind of\\njeans that men who deep condi tion their hair wear , and he looks like his\\nname is Blaine and his favorite type of girls are named Kassidee.\\n“You know him, right?” I turn back to Noah.\\nHe nods , “Terrance Holcomb. Up and coming Motocross star.” And\\nthen he pulls me into his body , and a gasp lodges in my throat as he fastens\\nmy chin strap for me. “And he’ s not looking at me, T iernan.”\\nNoah gets close, his chest brushing mine and making tingles spread\\nthrough my belly , and I suddenly go blank. Who were we talking about\\nagain?\\nHe leans in, his breath falling across my face, and I notice a three-inch\\nscar down his jaw as he gives me a wicked little smile.\\n“What are you doing?” I ask. Why’ s he so close?\\nBut he just smirks again. “Rubb ing it in,” he answers. And then his eyes\\ndart behind me to the guy across the street as he tightens my strap. “That\\nyou’re untouchable to him.”\\nBecause why? I’m yours? Gross.\\n“You’re nauseating,” I grumble.\\nAnd he just chuckles, shoving me away playfully and slipping on his\\nown helmet.\\nWe climb back on the bike and waste no time heading back toward\\nhome. I thought for sure he’d try to diddle around with friends or a\\ngirlfriend, but he races through town like he’ s in a hurry . Or in a hurry to get me back.\\nI start putting pieces together in my head. The little show he just put on\\nfor that guy in town. Jake’ s advice that I stay away from local guys. The\\norder to put on a proper shirt before I left today . Father and son don’t get\\nalong well, but they seem to have that in common, at least. Both of them are\\nstifling.\\nIt’s not entirely awful. I might’ ve liked to see my father act that way\\nfrom time to time. Really stifling is bad. A little stifling…I don’t know .\\nKind of feels like someone cares, I guess. Maybe I would’ve liked more\\nrules growing up.\\nUnfortunately for Jake and Noah, I’ve learned to live without them, so\\nit’s a little late.\\nI hold tight onto Noah as he climbs the roads up into the mountains\\nagain, but thankfully he’s going much slower now, because I feel gravity\\npulling me backward, and I’m afraid I’ll slide of f the bike.\\nI fist my hands, my muscles burning as I hold onto him.\\nWhen we get to a spot where the terrain evens out, I loosen my grip to\\nrelax my arms for a moment, and he pulls off to the side of the road, the\\nbike resting at the edge of a precipice.\\nMy stom ach flips a moment, but then I notice the view through the trees\\nbelow . The town spreads before us in a valley with the back drop of the\\nmountains, trees, and land lying in the distance. The great  expanse—\\neverything in one picture—makes my heart swell.\\n“Wow,” I say under my breath.\\nWe sit there for several moment s, taking in the view , and Noah removes\\nhis helmet, running his hand through his hair .\\n“You don’ t talk much, do you?” he asks.\\nI blink, coming back to reality . My parents just died. Should I be chatty?\\nBut I swallow the words before I can speak them. Their passing isn’t\\nwhy I am the way I am, but I’m not explaining myself just because\\neveryone else has their idea of what ‘normal’ should be.\\n“My dad thinks  you resent your parents and that’s why you’re  not sad\\nabout them dying,” Noah says, still looking out at the valley below. “I think\\nyou are sad, but not as much as you’re angry , because actually , it was the\\nother way around, wasn’ t it? They resented you.”\\nI harden my jaw. He and his father talked about me? Who says I’m not\\nsad? How would he know anything? Is there some checklist of specified behavior that’s acceptable when  family members die? Some people commit\\nsuicide after a loved one’ s death. Is that proof they’re sadder than me?\\nI drop my arms from his body .\\n“We’ve got the Internet here, too, you know?” he says. “Hannes and\\nAmelia de Haas. They were obsessed with each other .”\\nHe turns his head, so I can see his lips as he talks, but I’m frozen.\\nHe goes on, “And they had a kid, because that’s what they thought they\\nwere supposed to do, and then they realized parenthood wasn’ t all it was\\ncracked up to be. Raising you took them away from each other .”\\nI force the needles down my throat, feeling the tears start to pool, but I\\ndon’t let them collect. How does he know all that?\\n“So, they turned you over to whoever they could as soon as you were\\nold enou gh,” he tells me. “Boa rding schools, sleepaway summer camps,\\nnannies…”\\nMy chin shakes, and I let it, because I know he can’ t see me.\\n“You didn’ t resent your parents,” he finally says. “Y ou loved them.”\\n \\n \\nHours later, long after I’ve gone to bed, I hear his words again. Raising you\\ntook them away fr om each other . They r esented you. You loved them.\\nNo.\\nI try to back away , but something has my hand, and it aches. I pull and\\nyank, but the pain grows stronger , and I keep taking steps back, but no\\nmatter how hard I try I’m not going anywhere, and I can’ t get my hand free.\\nWhat has me? Let go. Let go.\\nI loved them once. I did. But…\\nI wrack my hand , trying to get it loose from whatever has it, but I can’t\\nturn, and I can’ t run.\\nI loved them once. But not now .\\nI don’ t know . I don’ t know .\\nMy eyes snap open, and I feel my cold thumb against the bare skin of\\nmy stomach. I blink and sit up, the pain in my hand throbbing as I wince. I\\nlook down and see my hand is caught in my T-shirt, the small hole I went to\\nbed with now a gaping tear in the shirt.\\nI pull my hand free, fisting it to get the blood flowing again.\\n“Shit,” I hiss. And then I shoo t out my other hand, knocking my alarm clock off the\\nnightstand with a growl.\\nI came here to get space. To get away , but if anything, I’m more fucked\\nup than when I came. Three days, and I’m having nightmares and night\\nterrors for the first time since fourth grade. I don’t need this shit. Noah had\\nno business bringing up personal things with me, much less regarding a\\nsituation he knows nothing about. If I want to talk, I will.\\nWiping the sweat off my upper  lip, I throw off the covers, turn on the\\nlamp, and hit the ground, digging under the bed for my suitcase. I don’t\\nhave to go home, but I don’t have to stay here. They don’t like me. I don’t\\nlike them. There are tons of places where people will leave me alone. I’ve\\nalways wanted to go to Costa Rica. Rent a treehouse. Hike with the spiders\\nand the snakes. Live amongst the insects of unusual size. All of it sounds\\nworlds better than here.\\nChar ging out of the room, I head downstairs, seeing every light is off\\nand hearing the grandfather clock ticking away .\\nJake will be up in a few hours. I should leave before he wakes.  I’m not\\nsure how far I’ll get. It’ll probably take me two days just to walk back to\\ntown with my luggage.\\nSwinging aroun d the bannister and heading into the kitchen, I open the\\ndoor to the garage and jog down the five steps to the washer and dryer .\\nChills spread down my legs, bare in my sleep shorts from the cold night,\\nand I open the dryer , pulling out the small load of clothes I’d dried earlier ,\\nincluding Noah’ s flannel.\\nI pull out a new, clean T-shirt, lifting up my ripped one to quickly\\nchange.\\nBut the doorknob to the shop door suddenly jiggles.\\nI jerk my head left, dropping my shirt back down.\\nMy mouth falls open and a thousand thoughts race through my head as I\\ntrain my ears in case I misheard . Jake and Noah are upstairs asleep, right?\\nIt’s after one in the morning.\\nLess than a second later, the handle shakes again, and a thud lands on\\nthe other side of the door. I jump and grab a rusty , steel bar off the\\nworktable. I stand frozen a mom ent longer before backing up and deciding\\nto run back in the house to get my uncle.\\nBut before I can spin around, the door is suddenly kicked open, and I\\nsuck in a breath as leaves blow in with the wind, and I see a mess of animal and blood as I stumble back into the railing and fall. I land on my ass and\\ncatch myself on my hands behin d me, the breath knocked out of me. What\\nthe hell?\\nA man steps over the threshold of the shop, wearing jeans and blood\\nrunning down his bare chest from the dead animal carcass hanging around\\nhis neck. I watch, my mouth suddenly dry and my heart lodged in my\\nthroat, as he walks over to the long wooden table and slings the dead deer,\\nfoot-long antlers  and all, onto the table and turns around to kick the shop\\ndoor closed again.\\nI gape in horro r. Streams of blood run down his back, cove ring his\\nspine, and I dart my eyes over to the animal, seeing its head hang limply off\\nthe table. I look away for a moment, pushing the bile back down my throat.\\nIs he where the deer came from that was here when I arrived a few days\\nago, too?\\nTurning around, his eyes meet mine as he heads to the wash basin next\\nto the dryer . He looks away again and turns on the water .\\nI try to wet my mouth, generate any kind of saliva, but the blood all\\nover him… Jesus. I fist my palms behind me.\\nWho…?\\nAnd then it finally hits me.\\nThis is Kaleb. The older son.\\nHe pulls  up the hose and leans over the sink, running the water over his\\ndark hair and down his back, cleaning the mess off his body . When he\\nstands up straight again, I watch as he rubs the water over the back of his\\nneck, and I notice a thin, faint tattoo running vertically from the bottom of\\nhis skull to his shoulder . Some kind of script.\\nHis hands glide down, over his stomach, making the muscles there flex\\nand the water drench his jeans. The overhead bulb swings back and forth\\nfrom the wind he let in, the light hitting him and then the darkness\\nswallowing him up again.\\nBut I see him turn his head again—looking at me. His dark eyes fall\\ndown my body and stop, zonin g in with his jaw flexing, and my stomach\\nflips and then drops, every hair on my body standing on end. The room\\nsuddenly feels so small.\\nI inhale a breath . “Um, you’re, uh…” I say, standing up. “You’re… um,\\nKaleb, right?” He meets my eyes again, and I see that his aren’ t really dark, after all.\\nThey’re green.\\nBut he looks mad.\\nHis black eyebrows narrow , casting this shadow over his gaze, and he\\nturns back around as if I’m not here, finishing his washing. He turns off the\\nwater and grabs a shop cloth, wiping off his face and neck and then runs it\\nover the top of his head, smoothing his hair back and soaking up the\\ndrenched strands.\\nHello?\\nWhat’ s his problem? Why isn’ t he answering me?\\nAs he turns toward me, though,  and tosses the shop cloth into the sink,\\nhe meets my eyes again, holding my stare, and then he cocks his head a\\nlittle. I almost laugh. The gesture makes him look so innocent. Like a\\ncurious puppy .\\nBut then his loaded eyes drop to my stomach again, and his chest rises\\nand falls heavier , and I clench my thighs. Instinctively , I put my hand where\\nhis eyes are, and I feel it.\\nThe bare skin of my stomach.\\nMy breath catches in my throat, and I look down, seeing I’m still\\nwearing my ripped T-shirt, the fabric torn and exposing my belly . I cringe.\\nThis whole time…\\nBut as I trail my hand, my fingers brush the exposed underside of my\\nfucking breast, and I stop breathing altogether . I pull down my shirt as\\nmuch as it will go and back up, ready to scramble for the stairs.\\nAs soon  as I move, he moves, walking right for me. He approaches,\\ndroplets of water hanging from his skin, and I dart toward the stairs, but he\\nshoots out his hand, grabs me, and shoves me into the wall instead.\\nWha…\\nI gasp, fear curdling in my stomach.\\nHe presses his body into mine, taking my waist in one hand and\\nplanting his other hand on the wall above my head, and dips his forehead\\ndown to mine, looking into my eyes. The embrace is intimate, and it feels\\nlike he’ll kiss me, but he doesn’ t. I open my mouth to say something, but\\nhis breath brushes my lips—hot and heady—and the room is spinning.\\nHe’s cold, but I feel warmer inside. Like I’m about to sweat.\\nReaching up, he takes the ribbon I’m wearing and runs it through his\\nfingers before bringing a lock of my hair to his nose and smelling it. Then he dips to the side, runnin g his nose over my ear, up my hairline,\\nand across my forehead, inhaling me.\\nSmelling me.\\nIt’s weird, but I can’t move. I shiver, pleasure at the gesture making my\\nbody react. My skin tightens, the flesh of my nipples pebbling and chafing\\nagainst my T-shirt, and I close my eyes for a moment, loving  the electric\\ncurrent flowing under my skin.\\nI should push him away .\\nI can’ t lift my arms for some reason, though.\\n“I, um,” I choke out. “I don’ t think you should—”\\nBut he reaches between us with one hand, his forehead resting on mine\\nwith fire in his eyes as he starts ripping open his belt and undoing his jeans.\\nWhoa, what? My mouth falls open. “Wait, stop.” I plant my hands on\\nhis chest. “Y ou can’ t…What are you…”\\nBut he presses himself into me, breathing harder with his teeth bared a\\nlittle, and I feel the hard ridge of him rubbing between my legs.\\nI exhale hard, my eyelids fluttering.\\nHe slides his hands down the back of my shorts, cupping my ass as he\\nlifts me into his arms and spins  us around. My stomach somersaults, and I\\ncan only grab onto him as he lands me down on the hood of a car, pulling\\nmy ass forward, so he nestles between my legs.\\n“Kaleb,” I say , trying to push him away . “Kal—”\\nHe fists the back  of my hair and presses his body into mine as he comes\\ndown on my mouth, hungry and wild, kissing me and shutting me up. His\\ntongue dives in, and I moan with the throbbing down low .\\nStop!\\nHoly shit.\\nHe rolls his hips into me, faste r and faster , breathing hard as he bites\\nand chews at my lips before sucking on my tongue so hard, my thighs are\\non fire.\\nWhat the hell is he doing? Fuck! Have we met or something?\\nI finally swallow . “Stop!” I shout, my pulse ringing in my ears. “Stop.\\nJust stop!”\\nBut he comes down on top of me, forcing me back onto the car, and his\\nhot mouth finds my stomach.\\nI shake my head , tears hanging at the corners, because it feels so good,\\nand I don’ t want it to. I don’ t want him to go lower . I don’ t want to wrap my legs around him. None of this feels good or warm, and none of it makes me\\nfeel soft on the inside like I could kiss him back.\\nI close my eyes as his lips suck and nibble their way across my stomach,\\nand I feel air hit my left breast, knowing it’s popped out from the rip in the\\nshirt again. I feel him pause, and I dig my nails into the car, because I know\\nhe sees it.\\nI wait for it, wanting to shake my head to stop him, but failing at even\\ntrying, and then…  he catches my nipple between his teeth, his warm mouth\\nsending heat pouring over my whole body . I let out a loud groan, hearing\\nmy nails screech across the hood of the car .\\n“Please stop,” I murmur , but I know he hears me. He growls and yanks\\nme back down to the end of the car, diving for my stomach again as he\\nstarts to pull of f my sleep shorts.\\nI grit my teeth together . “Stop,” I mutter .\\nBut he doesn’ t. His kisses only get lower , trailing over my hip bones as\\nhe eats me up, and warmth pools between my legs, almost burning with\\nneeding something there.\\n“Stop,” I mouth.\\nHe gets my shorts and panties down over my ass and come s down,\\nsucking my lower belly , just an inch above my clit, and I rise up, growling\\nas I slap him across the face. “Stop, I said! Stop!”\\nHe freezes, looking at me in the eye and glaring. Sweat glisten s down\\nhis neck , and his breathing is ragged as he digs his fingers in my hips,\\nfisting his hands.\\n“When someone tells you to stop, you stop!” I bark. “Can’ t you fucking\\nunderstand? Are you stupid or something?”\\nAnd he snarls, grabbing me by my upper arms and scowling down at\\nme. A whimper escapes, but I scowl right-the-fuck back.\\nHis chest heaves, and I can feel the heat on his breath and still see the\\ndesire in his eyes, and I feel it, too, even though I hate to admit it. For a\\nmoment there—maybe longer—I wanted to do this. For a moment, I was\\nsoft again.\\nIt was hard to stop.\\nBut this is his fault. I told him to stop like six times, and I certainly\\ndidn’ t invite the attention, so his blue balls are on him. I don’t have to love\\nthe first person I fuck, but I don’t want to be scared, either . He’s like a\\nmachine. He glares down at me, not letting go, and I stare back.\\n“Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey,” someone says, rushing into the garage.\\n“Stop! Man, get of f her.”\\nNoah comes up, pulling Kaleb’ s fingers off my arms and pushing him\\naway .\\n“Dude, she ain’t a townie,” he tells Kaleb, holding his shoulders and\\nlooking him in the eye.\\nBut Kale b’s glow er is still on me. I quickly slide off the hood of the car\\nand fix my shorts, seeing his gaze fall down my body again. Not a townie?\\nLike it’ s okay to treat anyone like that?\\n“Dude, look at me,” Noah barks at him.\\nSlowly , Kaleb pulls his gaze away and finally meets his brother ’s.\\n“It’s Dad’s… brother ’s daughte r,” Noah explains, and I hear humor in\\nhis tone. “Remember? The step-brother he hates? This is his kid.” Noah\\ngestures to me. “She’ s family . She’s staying with us for a while . You can’t\\nfuck her .”\\nAnd then Noah releases him, laughing under his breath.\\n“This isn’t funny !” I snap. And then I glare at Kaleb, now able to finally\\nfind my goddamn voice. “What the hell is the matter with you? Huh?”\\n“Just cut him some slack,” Noah says. “He’ s always starving when he\\ncomes back from being in the woods this long.”\\n“Then eat!”\\n“That’ s what he was doing,” Noah shoots back, glancing at me.\\nEating.\\nEating me.\\nOh, you’re fucking clever , aren’ t you? Assholes.\\nKaleb watches me, cocking his head a little to the side again, and then\\nhe bring s up his thumb, wiping the corner of his mouth like you do after a\\nmeal.\\nIn the woods. In. That’ s what they meant. Kaleb disappears into the\\nforest for spells.\\nMaybe he should disappear again.\\n“Why do you keep answering for him?” I ask Noah.\\n“Because he doesn’ t talk.”\\n“What?”\\n“He doesn’t speak, Tiernan.” Noah turns his head only enough for me to\\nsee his lips move. “He hasn’ t spoken since he was four years old.” I look at Kaleb, not sure how to process the information. A touch of pity\\nwinds through me, but I think he sees it, because he glares down at me as he\\nrefastens his jeans and yanks his belt free, the end of it snapping in the air\\nwith his anger .\\nI flex my jaw . “Is he deaf, too?” I snap. “I told him to stop.”\\n“He can hear you just fine.” Noah sighs. “He’ s just not used… to\\nwomen…”\\n“Saying no?”\\n“Women like you,” Noah retorts.\\nLike me? There are plenty of girls like me in town.\\nKaleb casts me one more look before he turns around and heads up the\\nstairs, back into the house, and Noah faces me, his eyes taking in my\\nclothes. I quickly pull my shirt down, but I’m too mad to be embarrassed.\\nI can’ t remember why I came to the shop in the first place.\\nMute? He’s mute? He can speak. Noah said he hasn’ t spoken since he\\nwas four , not that he lost his ability to speak when he was four . Why doesn’ t\\nhe talk?\\nAnd what does he do in the woods by himself?\\nI still see his eyes, looking down at me, when he pushed me into the\\nwall and rested his forehead against mine. The way he looked at me…\\nHis mouth on my… My cheeks warm.\\n“He won’ t do it again,” Noah tells me, turning around to face me with\\nan amused smile. “He didn’ t know who you were, T iernan. Sorry .”\\nHe linge rs for a moment longer and then turns to leave, follow ing his\\nbrother .\\nAnd I stand in the garage, staring at the slivers in the hood of the car\\nwhere I scratche d the paint just a few minutes ago. For several minutes, I’m\\nlost in thought about where that would’ve gone if Noah hadn’ t come in. If I\\nhadn’ t forced myself to push his brother away .\\nAnd how much of it might not have been Kaleb’ s fault.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nThe next morning, giggles pierce the air, and I open my eyes, blinking away\\nthe sleep.\\nThat was a girl.\\nPropping myself up on my elbows, I train my ears, hearing the steady\\nrocking of something coming from Noah’ s bedroom, and then a moan\\nfollowed by something banging into the wall.\\nI roll my eyes and fall back to the bed. They really are living their best\\nlife, aren’ t they? Must be nice to have your bed buddies come to you. At the\\ncrack of dawn every morning.\\nDoors open and close in the house, and I check my phone, seeing it’s\\njust after five-thirty . Turning my head, I see my unpacked suitcase still\\nlaying open on the floor next to the pile of clean laundry I’d brought up last\\nnight.\\nI hadn’t finished packing. And I hadn’ t changed my clothes. I was still\\nwearing the shredded T -shirt Kaleb found me in last night.\\nMemories rush through my mind, and my chest starts rising and falling\\nfaster as everything that happened in the garage floods me again.\\nWho knew I’d fold so easily? I was so ready to wrap my legs around\\nanyone who showed me the least bit of attention.\\nI close my eyes, still feeling it. The need for him to go lower . My hand\\nfinds my stomach under the covers, and for a moment, I pretend it’s his\\nhand. Did I feel good to him?\\nBut I blink, shaking my head. No. No.\\nI throw off the covers and sit up. His behavior was ridiculous. What’ s\\neven more ridiculous is he wouldn’ t have tried to get it on with a complete\\nstranger if it hadn’ t worked for him in the past. He didn’ t like what he felt.\\nHe was horny , and I could’ve been anyone.\\nStanding up, I pull off my shirt, noticing a few red spots around the\\nhem, and it only takes a moment before it hits me.\\nBlood.\\nThe deer ’s blood.\\nUgh. He still had some on him when he was…on top of me. I growl\\nunder my breath and throw the shirt over to the waste basket, half of it\\ncatching on the rim and hanging over the side.\\nPulling on a new one, I grab my toothbrush and toothpaste, opening my\\nbedroom door and heading for the bathroom. Moans, cries, and “Wow” by\\nPost Malone carry out from Noah’s room into the hallway , so I rush and\\nswing open the door to the bathroom, seeing my uncle standing  there at the\\nsink, a towel wrapped around his waist.\\nI stop, his wet torso and hair glistening in the dim light, and I quickly\\nlook away . This is a big house. It would’ve been prudent to add a second\\nbathroom.\\nI open my mouth to apologize at barging in, but the door is equipped\\nwith a lock. It’ s not my fault he didn’ t use it.\\nThe other door to the bathroom, the one that comes from his bedroom,\\nopens, and I see the same wom an appear that was here the other day. She\\nwears a tight, red, halter -top dress, her long brown hair pulle d up into a\\nponytail, and black heels. She kisses him on the cheek, lingering long\\nenough to nibble at his jaw a moment, and then walks out, squeezing past\\nme with barely a look. I watch her walk down the stairs, disapp earing, and\\nthen turn my head back aroun d, instinctively glancing at the darkened\\nstairwell leading up to Kaleb’ s room.\\n“Shower?” Jake finally asks.\\nI turn around, meeting his eyes in the mirror as he wipes the toothpaste\\noff his mouth. A drop of water spills down his back.\\n“No, I… just wanted to brush my teeth.” I turn to leave. “I’ll wait.”\\n“Four people and one shower ,” he calls out, stopping me. “Don’ t be\\nshy.”\\n“Would you be shy if I were walking around in a towel?” I shoot back. Seriously .\\nHe meets my gaze, an amused tilt to his lips, and he nods. “I’ll try to get\\ninto the habit of bringing my clothes with me to my shower , okay?” And\\nthen clarifies, “I’ll try. We’ve been without a woman in this house a long\\ntime.”\\nI arch an eyebrow at him. There are constantly women in this house.\\n“You know what I mean,” Jake says, knowing exactly what I’m\\nthinking.\\nWhatever .\\n“You don’t need to change your habits,” I tell him. “If I’m not\\nstaying...”\\nHe glances at me again and then grabs a can of shaving cream, not\\nsaying whatever it is I know he wants to. I walk in, shaking my head a little\\nbefore wetting my toothbrush and applying toothpaste. I’m not waiting for\\nhim to get done. What kind of mountain man doesn’ t just grow a beard?\\nI recap the toothpaste and toss it down behind the fauce t. “You\\nshowered after work yesterday ,” I mumble, raising the toothbr ush for my\\nmouth. “Do you normally take another one in the morning?”\\n“Only when I get dirty at night, too,” he retorts.\\nI falter, darting my eyes up to see him rubbing shaving cream over his\\njaw and neck without missing a beat, because how else would a man get\\ndirty in his own bed at night? I think of the woman with the toned thighs\\nand red lips who just walked out of here.\\nI blink and start brushing my teeth.\\n“You did a good job on the stalls yesterday ,” he says.\\nI did?\\n“The boys have been doing it their whole lives, and they just don’t give\\na shit. It was nice to see it done how I would do it.”\\nI nod once but keep my head down as I brush. He’ s placating me.\\n“Do you have a boyfriend, T iernan?” he asks.\\nI shoot my eyes up at him. He looks at me, shaving foam cove ring the\\nlower half of his face as he washes of f his hands.\\n“Back home in L.A.?” he clarifies. “Do you have a boyfriend?”\\nI spit the toothpaste out, but instead of answering, I go back to brushing.\\n“Have you had any men?” he asks more bluntly when I don’t respond.\\n“Whatsoever?” I slow my strokes, my breathing turning shallow . Is he asking if I’ve had\\nsex?\\nEvery inch of my clothing touches my skin, and my blood courses hot\\nthrough my veins. I squeeze the toothbrush in my hand.\\nSpitting once more, I rinse out my mouth and finally raise my eyes,\\nlooking at him in the mirror . What does he want from me?\\n“You’re still a girl,” he says, guessing the answer without me telling\\nhim, “and you still need some raising.”\\nI watch him tilt his head back, glide the razor up his neck, against the\\ngrain.\\n“You should stay ,” he tells me. “It’ s nice having a woman in the house.”\\nI watch him, trying not to. The smooth, tan skin of his neck revealed\\nwith every stroke. The water still clinging to his muscular shoulders and\\nchest. The way the towel hugs the V around his hips, and I blink and cast\\nmy eyes away , but I can’t help but steal another glance, because I like\\nlooking at it.\\nThe way he and Kaleb may not look alike in the face, but you can\\ntotally see they’re related when they’re half-dressed.\\nMaybe I should tell him about last night. How his son cornered  me and\\ntried to screw me on the hood of his car and how maybe this isn’t the safest\\nplace for me, after all.\\nWe don’ t get along. Noah pushes my bad buttons, and I’m sleeping even\\nworse since I got here.\\nMaybe I should tell him I’m leaving.\\nBut inste ad, I pick up the shavin g cream, pour some foam into my hand,\\nand start dabbing it on my face as he stops shaving to watch me.\\nAs soon  as my cheeks are covered, and I look like Santa, I pick up my\\ntoothbrush again to use the handle as a razor .\\n“You got no idea how to raise girls,” I tell him.\\nHe smirks at me in the mirror . “Want me to make a man out of you\\nthen?”\\n“You can try.” And I hold my toothbrush ready . Maybe he’ll let me do\\nsome ‘man’ s’ work, then.\\nHe snorts and leans over the sink, and I follow , taking his lead.\\nStroke by stroke, I mimic his technique, against the grain up the neck,\\nwith the grain down his cheek and jaw , and over the top of the upper lip. W e stand side by side, peering into the mirror , and stopping periodically to rinse\\noff our “razors” before continuing.\\nHe catches my eyes and smiles before leading me through the final\\nstrokes, but his arm brushing mine makes my heart beat harder as the smell\\nof his clean body fills the bathroom.\\nWhen we’re done and only a few smudges of foam remain, he pulls a\\ntowel off the rack and cleans off my face, and for a minute, I feel like a kid\\nand want to laugh for some reason.\\nBut when he pulls the towel away , he looks down at me, and my hidden\\nsmile sinks to the bottom of my stomach, and so does his. He’ s close.\\nHis eyes hold mine, and we stand there, heat filling the room so hot I…\\nI swallow , seeing his Adam’ s apple rise and then fall, too.\\n“Looks like I failed,” he says barely above a whisper . “There’ s no\\nhiding what you are.”\\nA girl.\\nHe almost sounds remorseful at that fact.\\nHe turns away , slowly wiping off his own face. “I’m hungry .\\nPancakes?”\\nBut I barely hear him, standing there and watching him and the words\\nflowing out of my mouth before I can stop them. “I may never be a man,” I\\ntell him, “but I won’ t always be a girl, either .”\\nI pause long enough to see him falter and his face fall, and I can’t help\\nthe small smile that peeks out as I turn and leave the bathroom.\\nSurely , I can take on more responsibilities.\\nWhen I’m a woman.\\n \\n \\nI pour some pancake batter onto the griddle, hearing it sizzle as I refill the\\nladle and pour another circle, one after the other . I watch the batter bubble\\nagainst the heat, rubbing the smooth surface of my thumbnail.\\nFor once, I’m actually happy to be cooking their breakfast. Jake and\\nNoah are outside, taking care of their morning chores, but I still haven’ t\\nseen Kaleb, and rather than hide in my room and dread running into him, I\\ncan just stay busy .\\nWhy the hell isn’ t my suitcase packed? After I left my uncle stunned stupid in the bathroom earlier , I dressed\\nand made my bed, leaving my empty luggage abandoned on the floor , but\\neven if the episo de with Kaleb last night had never happened, I’m not sure I\\nwould’ve gone through with packing it then, either .\\nI lay the ladle in the bowl and pick up the spatula, flipping the pancakes\\nand making the batter splatter .\\nMaybe that’s why I always came home on school breaks. Too desperate\\nnot to be alone.\\nI whip around to grab the plate and see Kaleb.\\nI stop. He leans against the refrigerator , staring at me, and my heart\\njumps as I clench my thighs. How long has he been standing there?\\nHis green eyes watch me, the same curious expression he wore last\\nnight, and I can’t even hear the branches outside blowing again st the house\\nbecause my pulse pounds in my ears.\\nWhat is he staring at?\\nLocking my jaw, I grab the plate off the island and spin back around,\\nscooping the pancakes onto the plate. He’s still dressed in jeans, but these\\nones are clean, and he looks showered, although his hair is disheveled like\\nhe just got up. I guess Jake doesn’t hold him to the same standard he holds\\nNoah and me with his five-thirty wake-up calls?\\nHis eyes burn my back, but after a moment, I hear the fridge open and\\nclose and then feel him approach  my side. Is he going to apolog ize? What if\\nI hadn’t been a step-cousin? What if I’d actually been blood when he\\ndecided to ignore my protests last night?\\nSlowly , I clear the griddle and dole out four more scoops of batter as he\\npours himself a glass of juice, but even though my eyes are on my task, all I\\ncan see is him next to me. He smells…\\nLike leather . Like musky bodywash. He must’ve just showered then.\\nLast night it was…rain, trees, firewood, and sweat. He smel led like the\\nwoods. Heat pools between my legs at the memory .\\nI shake my head. For Christ’ s sake.\\n“Leave the juice out,” I tell him.\\nBut he doesn’ t listen.\\nHe turns around as if he didn’ t hear me and takes the juice, sticking it\\nback into the refrigerator .\\n“You like blueberry?” I ask. “Buttermilk?” I don’t give a damn what he likes. I just want him to make me go\\nupstairs and pack my suitcase.\\n“Chocolate chip?” I keep going, pushing us both. “Pumpkin? Whole\\ngrain?”\\nHe picks up his glass of orange juice and strolls over to the table,\\ngulping it as he goes on like I don’ t exist.\\nI tighten my fist around the spatula as I flip the pancakes, breathing hard\\nthrough my nose.\\n“How many would you like?” I drone on. “Three? Four?”\\nI glance over to see if he’s nodding or shaking his head or holding up\\nfingers to tell me how many he wants, but he just sets his glass down on the\\ntable and pulls out a chair .\\nI pull out the plug of the griddl e and add the fresh pancakes to the pile\\non the plate, grabbing the syrup and forks. The front door swin gs open and\\nthe floor creaks with footsteps as Jake and Noah come barreling in. How do\\nthey know when breakfast is ready?\\nI carry the pancakes to the table, setting the plate down in the middle as\\nNoah grabs a glass of milk and Jake washes his hands. Both immediately\\nover to the table.\\nSteam from blueberry pancakes  wafts into the air as the guys sit down,\\nand I twist around to pick up the plates of f the island, my anger still rising.\\nI set a plate down in front of Jake, one down in front of Noah, and the\\nlast down in front of me, feeling Kaleb’ s eyes on me, because I didn’ t give\\nhim one.\\nI don’ t cook for you.\\nNoah and Jake must realize something is happening because they stop\\nmoving. I glance up, seeing their eyes move between Kaleb and me, and I\\nknow Noah can guess the tension between us, but I don’t know if Jake\\nknows yet. Noah probably didn’ t talk about last night for fear of getting his\\nbrother in trouble.\\nWithout blinkin g, though, Kaleb picks up the plate of pancakes in the\\nmiddle of the table, doles out three to Jake, three to Noah, and then pauses\\nonly a moment, holding my eyes, before dropping the plate back onto the\\ntable, right in front of himself and taking the rest of the pancakes. Picking\\nup the syrup, he pours it on his stack without leaving any for me.\\nPrick. Noah clears his throat, but I can hear the laugh, while Jake sighs, taking\\nhis plate  and setting it down in front of me. Reaching over to the island, he\\ntakes another one and uses his fork to pick a couple of pancakes off Kaleb’ s\\nover-loaded plate.\\n“You both met already , I see,” Jake grumbles.\\nBut no one responds as the boys start eating.\\n“This looks good, Tiernan,” Jake says, trying to ease the tension.\\n“Blueberry pancakes are the only thing your father and I—”\\n“I don’ t care,” I spit out and push the plate away .\\nEveryone quiets, and I stand up and grab an apple from the fruit basket.\\nTaking a bite, I walk over to fill up my water bottle from the refrigerator .\\nI know I’m being rude, and I’m sorry for it.\\nMaybe I’ll take a hike. Stretch my legs, give them some space.\\nThe kitchen is quiet for a few more moments, but I hear Noah speak up.\\n“I’m finishing the Lawrence bike today ,” he tells his father , I’d assume.\\n“The guys are coming. I’m gonna take it out to Ransom’ s Run. T est it out.”\\n“Don’ t take all day,” Jake tells him, his tone a bite now. “We have more\\nwork to do.”\\nHis patience from a moment ago is gone, and I know I pissed him of f.\\nI look over and see him turn to Kaleb next as he stabs his plate with his\\nfork. “And don’ t you disappear , either ,” he orders his oldest.\\nAll the men fall silent, hurrying through their breakfast, and the tension\\nin the room now thicker than mud.\\nI twist the lid back on and prepare to leave the dishes for them, but\\nwhen I turn around to go, I catch  Kaleb staring at me again. Except his eyes\\nare on my legs.\\nI wear ripped jean shorts, not too short, and a flannel buttoned up to my\\nneck.\\nI drift my gaze around the table, noticing I have more clothes on than\\nany of them. Jake and Kaleb aren’t wearing any shirts, and Noah’ s tee has\\nthe sides cut out, giving glimpses of the smooth, tan chest underneath.\\nKaleb’ s black hair against his sun-kissed face.\\nJake’ s toned shoulders and narrow waist.\\nThe veins in Noah’ s forearms and…\\nI straighten, swallow , and turn around, quickly leaving the room.\\nI need to get out of here.\\n   \\nI hit the gas and pull the truck up the driveway until I reach the top of the\\nincline, feeling the gravel kick up under me. Turning off the engine, I take\\nthe work gloves off the passenger -side seat and hop out of the truck,\\nheading for the bed as I pull them on.\\n“You find your way okay?” Jake approaches, dropping the tailgate for\\nme.\\nI nod.\\n“The guys were helpful?”\\n“Yes.”\\nWe both hop up into the bed to start unloading the hay .\\nAfter breakfast, he’d asked me to take the truck to town to pick up some\\nbales of hay, and I happily agreed once I learned I could go on my own.\\nSome air. Some space. It was just as good as a hike, and hey, I got to go to\\nmy first Tack & Feed store. Thankfully , it sported no racks with tabloids for\\nsale, so I was able to avoid news from home.\\nMusic and laughter come from the garage, and I look over, seeing a\\ngroup of motorb ikes parked off to the side. Must be the friends Noah was\\ntalking about when he said he was taking the bike out today .\\nA coupl e of women hang out nearby as others talk in the garage, and I\\nwatch them in their jeans and summer tops, laughing and smiling. How\\nmuch longer will the weather be nice enough to ride? Seems like fun.\\nJake and I unload the hay, gripp ing the wires and hauling each bale over\\nto the stable. One of the girls smiles as I pass.\\nNone of them wear make-up,  no fancy manicures, and no stylish\\nclothes, but they don’t need it. They’re pretty , dressed to play, and for a\\nmoment, I want to be one of them.\\nI carry a bale into the barn, walking it down to a stall. Is Kale b going\\nwith them?\\nHow does he get along with friends without speaking? Does he have\\nfriends? I mean, if he’s like that as a mute, can you imagine what would\\ncome out of his mouth if he spoke?\\nI shake my head. Curiosity swirls in my mind over what happ ened to\\nhim at the age of four that made him stop talking, but I push the thought\\naway . We’ve all got problems.\\n“I want to hear you,” someone pants. I slow as I hit the stall.\\n“Show me what you want me to do,” she whispers.\\nI almost drop the hay .\\nHer voice is barely audible, so soft like she’ s hanging on by a thread.\\nI set the hay down, taking a step back. It could be anyone. There’ s lots\\nof peopl e here right now, and I don’t want to be embarrassed . Slowly , I\\nretreat.\\nBut then I hear a grunt, a shuf fle of hay , and a small cry . I halt.\\n“I’m gonna make you moan,” she tells him. “You’re gonna like it that\\nmuch.”\\nI don’t know why, but I take a soft step forward. Following the sounds\\nto the far stall at the end of the stable, I get to the door with the top half\\npartially open and listen closely again.\\n“Come on…” she moans.\\nI hold my breath and peer through the crack in the door. Skin and hands\\nfill my view as he threads his fingers through her long black hair, and she\\nkneels between his legs and sucks his…\\nI look away for a second, heat rising to my cheeks.\\nBut her soft little whimpers draw my attention again.\\nHer head moves up and down on him, her hands running up his jean-\\nclad thighs and gripping his belt, pulling his pants down more, so that I see\\nhis hips and the curve of his ass.\\nI can’ t see her face, and I can’ t see what she’ s doing to him, but I know .\\nI slide my eyes up—taking in his muscles, skin, shiny with swea t again,\\nand before I get to his face, I know who it is.\\nKaleb has his head tilted back, his eyes closed, and breathes hard as he\\ngrips her hair, forcing her up and down on his cock. The muscles in his\\nforearms flex, and his hair damn near hangs in his eyes, but I watch his\\nface, the woman forgotten. Sweat dampens the ends of his hair, sticking to\\nhis skin, and his lips tighten periodically , because he…\\nHe likes it. I hear her moan, even with him in her mouth, and he pulls\\nher down on him again and again as his eyebrows pinch together .\\nAnd then his eyes open.\\nHis head  tilts forward again, and his gaze pins me through the crack like\\nhe knew I was here the whole time.\\nShit. I stop breathing again. My body tenses, and shame burns my skin, but\\nhe starts  moving  faster , pumping himself into her mouth now as his eyes\\nburn a hole right through me.\\nMy mouth opens, because it’s the only thing that will move. I don’t\\neven see her anymore as he leans forward into her, one hand still in her hair\\nand one hand holding a sideboard as he fucks her mouth. His hips pump\\nfaster and faster , his eyes suddenly piercing like they did last night when he\\npushed me into the wall and… smelled me.\\nA drop of sweat falls down my stomach under my flannel, and I almost\\nfind myself starting to move with him, entranced.\\nI lean into the door, soaking up the only few centimeters closer I can\\nget.\\nShe groans, he and I stare at each other , and all I see is how he would’ve\\nmoved with me last night.\\nIf I hadn’ t stopped him.\\nBut then a moan  escapes, and I don’t realize it came from me until I see\\nthe corner of his mouth curl into a smile. I suck in a breath, finally realizing\\nwhat the hell I’m doing.\\nFuck. I turn away , putting my hand over my mouth and squeezing my\\neyes shut.\\nShit.\\nBehind me, I hear him grunt under his breath, and then hiss, fast, heavy\\nbreathing pourin g in and out of his lungs as I lean against the stall, listening\\nto him come.\\nI shudder , she whimpers, and I run, out of the stable and into the late\\nmorning air .\\nWhy did I do that? What the hell was I doing?\\nA light layer of sweat covers my back, and I wish I had a tank top on\\nunder this so I could pull of f the long-sleeved shirt.\\nHe’s vile. Jake was right. He and Noah are nothing compared to that.\\nAnd I’ll bet he enjoys himself, too, reaping all the benefits of playing\\nthe mysterious, tortured soul who doesn’ t speak, but it’s just so alluring and\\nsweet, because women want to save him.\\nI don’ t care what happened to him when he was four .\\nAnd I did nothing wrong. I heard a cry. I went to look. Shock prevented\\nme from moving once I saw what it was. That’ s it. I pull Noah’ s baseball cap off and turn it around, the bill shielding me\\nfrom the sun as I head back to the truck where Jake is sweeping out the bed.\\n“Hey , Tiernan!” I hear Noah call.\\nI tense, wondering if he saw me watching his brother . Turning around, I\\nsee everyone loading onto their bikes, the two girls I saw earlier climbing\\nonto their own, and Noah smiling from his.\\nI raise my eyebrows.\\n“You want to come with us?” he asks.\\nI look behind him, recognizing the guy from town yesterday .\\nTerrance. The one he apparently  doesn’ t like, but I guess they travel in\\nthe same  circles, and it’s a small town, so... He pulls on his helm et, a smile\\nin his eyes as he watches me.\\nI glance at Jake for a way out.\\nHe jump s down from the bed, jerking his chin at me. “I have to make a\\nrun to town anyway . Go ahead,” he tells me. “Have fun, but stay with\\nNoah.”\\nMy stomach sinks. I don’t like being around people I don’t know . I\\ndon’t like being around people.\\nWhen I turn back around, though, I see Kaleb strolling out of the\\nstables, pulling his shirt on, and the girl he had in the stall following him.\\nThe girl from the store yesterday . The one who tried to get in my face.\\nI stare at her—t ight jeans, loose green tank top, long black hair—and a\\nbrick sits in my stomach.\\n“Come on.” Noah holds a helmet out to me. “Ride with me.”\\nAnd for some reason, I kind of want to now. My feet move without\\nthinking.\\nI walk over to Noah, meeting Terrance Holcomb’ s eyes for a moment as\\nI pass.\\nBut as soon as I stop at Noah’ s bike, turn my cap around, and reach for\\nthe helmet, another hand shoots out and pulls it away before I can get to it.\\nI look up, seeing Kaleb. He only hesitates a moment, glaring down at\\nme, before tossing the helmet to the ground and away from me. Taking my\\narm, he pulls me away from the bikes, and I stumble and straighten just in\\ntime as he walks into me, forcing me backward.\\nMy heart hammers in my chest as he stares down at me, and then he\\njerks his chin toward the house. He doesn’ t have to say a word for me to\\nknow he’ s ordering me inside. Away from them. A way from him.\\n“Kaleb,” I hear Noah chide.\\nBut snickers and snorts break out around the group, and despite the\\ntwinge of anger I feel, my eyes start to burn.\\nAway. He looks down at me, jerking his chin again. Away.\\nYou’re not going.\\nJake stands in the truck bed, suddenly aware something is going on, and\\nI clench my jaw to fight the tears. Suddenly , I want nothing more than to be\\naway . Where I can’ t be seen or looked at or detested.\\n“No, it’ s fine,” I say quietly to Noah, choking on the tears in my throat.\\nAnd I back away , turning for the house.\\n“Tiernan,” Jake calls.\\nBut I cut him off. “I didn’ t want to go anyway ,” I tell him, my eyes\\nwatering. “Sounds boring.”\\nAnd I jog up the stairs and walk into the house, hearing the engines rev,\\nand after a moment, the high-pitched whir of them speeding away .\\nI head for the staircase, but I halt in the middle of the living room,\\nrealizing there’ s nothing up there for me either . Another closed door.\\nAnother place to hide. Another room to pass the time until…\\nI drop my eyes, needles prickling the back of my throat.\\nUntil I don’ t have to worry about being seen.\\nMy chin trembles, and a tear falls. I swipe it away .\\nI don’t want to think, because then I’ll be fucking alone, and that’s all I\\never am.\\nThe truck fires up outside, and I close my eyes, thinking I should be\\nrelieved my uncle is leaving, too. I should be thankful he didn’ t come in\\nafter me. Neither one of us is the heart-to-heart kind, are we?\\nHe’s giving me space.\\nBut he just leaves, the sound of his engine disappearing down the road,\\nand I stand there for less than a minute before setting off upstairs and\\nopening my bedroom door .\\nI bypass my suitcase, still laying empty on the floor , and grab my\\nbackpack, double-checking my little First Aid kit is inside and take my\\nsunscreen, stuffing it in the front  pocket. Pulling my phone off the charger, I\\nleave the room and head downs tairs, filling up a water bottle and packing a\\nfew snacks.\\nI walk toward the front door , but then I stop, remembering. Protection.\\nI head back through the kitchen and open the door to the garage,\\nstepping down the few stairs and gazing at the row of rifles on the rack.\\nI wish I didn’ t have to carry one. I’d look like an idiot—or a terrorist—\\nwalking down Ventura with a firearm slung over my shoulder . But my uncle\\nis right. This isn’ t the city . I could run into trouble.\\nI chew my lips, no idea what I’m really looking at. I don’t know about\\npreciseness or ease of use, so I just grab the one I know how to use and\\nopen the drawer underneath, finding the bullets. Loading the weapon, I\\nswing the strap of the rifle over my shoulder .\\nQuickly , I sift through my uncle’s tools, finding a flashlight, and then\\ngrab a clean towel off the basket on top of the dryer . I put everything in my\\npack, zip it up, and pull it on, ready to go.\\nStepping out of the shop and around the house, I head for the woods,\\nclimbing the steep incline Jake took me through on the horse the other day.\\nI think I remember the way. It’s a straight shot up and around some rocks,\\nand then I contin ue on, going deeper into the trees. There should be a worn\\npath… I would think.\\nI should text my uncle and let him know where I’m going.\\nBut instead, I keep my phone tucked away in my pocket.\\nReaching the top of the hill, I follow the dirt path around some boulders,\\nkeeping my eyes open and my ears trained, but after a few minutes, the\\nheadache that always seems to be aching around the back of my head fades\\naway , and I inhale deep breaths, smelling the needles of the evergreens and\\nthe wet earth under my shoes.\\nMaybe I should turn back and put on Noah’ s old boots he loaned me\\nyesterday , but I can’t care that my sneakers have zero traction right now.\\nMy stom ach is unknotting, and all I can hear is the creaking of the trees and\\nthe water coming from somewhere.\\nAfter a while, I’m not even paying attention to my surro undings\\nanymore. I follow the trail I’m not sure is an actual trail, but it winds\\nthrough the trees, guiding me deeper into the quiet and the solitude, and I\\npeer through to see if I can make out the peak in the distance. But it’s too\\nthick.\\nI take off Noah’ s hat and shake out my locks, the breeze feeling good on\\nmy scalp and the wind clearing my head. I close my eyes. But suddenly , I hear a rock fall behind me, bouncing off a boulder or\\nsomething, and I jerk around, scanning the woods I just walked through.\\nThe pulse in my neck throbs as the sunlight streams through the trees to\\nthe forest floor , and I train my eyes, trying to see around trunks and rocks. I\\nreach to my side, clutching the butt of the rifle.\\nIf it’s an animal, I won’ t see it until it wants me to. I swallow , trying to\\ncatch sight of anything.\\nBut there’ s nothing.\\nNo movement.\\nI remain still for a few more moments, making sure nothing is there and\\nturn around, occasionally lookin g over my shoulder and keeping my eyes\\nopen just in case. It’s probabl y nothing. Trees fall, rocks spill, animals\\nscurry…\\nI reach the top of another steep incline, the land leveling out, and look at\\nthe trail ahead, trying to remember how much farther it is.\\nBut then I look left, doing a double-take, and see it.\\nI smile.  Like actually smile.\\nI head for the pond Jake and I passed the other day, relieved I didn’t get\\nlost. I climb down the rocks and come to the little beach and look out at the\\nrock walls surrounding the water . Lush foliage hugs the sides, trees tower\\noverhead, but there’ s enough sunlight getting through to shimmer across the\\nstill water .\\nIt’s empty . No people, no noise, and the warmth of the sun feels good.\\nI debate for a moment if I should strip, glancing around as if someone\\nmay be watching, but I decide to keep my clothes on. Or most of them.\\nI set the rifle down and drop my pack before unbuttoning Noah’ s shirt.\\nWearing a sports bra underneath, I pull off his shirt and drop it to the\\nground with my hat, starting my Spotify playlist on my phone and setting it\\ndown before walking into the water with my sneakers on. I’ll get dry on the\\nwalk back. I’d rather not be in my underwear if anyone shows up. Or\\nshoeless if an animal does.\\nI wade out and then shoot off, “Look Back at It” playing as I swim out\\nto the middle of the small pond . Another smile I can’t hold back spreads\\nacross my face.\\nThis feels good.  The cool water sends chills over my body , giving me a\\nsudden burst of energy, and I dive down and then come back up, my hair\\nnow soaked and slicked back. Lying back, I float, the weightlessness and water in my ears making me\\nfeel alone.\\nBut not lonely for once.\\nI glide my fingers under the water , my hair floating around me, and I\\nsmile again, because it’s the first time since I’ve been here that the world\\nfeels like a big place. It helps to get outside. T o get lost a little.\\nI always for got that.\\nA faint rumble hits my ears, and I lift my head up, treading water as I\\nsee a dirt bike pull up to the beach.\\nMy face falls and my body tenses. Who is that?\\nHe takes off his helmet, a dark blond head coming into view as his hair\\nsticks up, kind of all messy-se xy, and it takes me less than a second to\\nrecognize T errance Holcomb. Whom I’ve yet to actually meet.\\n“Hey ,” he calls out, climbing of f his bike.\\nI don’t respond. What is he doing here? I look and listen. Are they all\\ncoming?\\nHe heads for the water , pulling off his boots and socks, and I realize\\nhe’s coming in. Keeping his jeans on, he walks into the pond, pulling off his\\nshirt and tossing it back to the rocks.\\nHe reaches down and scoops up some water , splashing it on his face,\\nrunning it over his hair and down the back of his neck, and wetting his\\nchest.\\nLoooooove the tribal tattoos. Wonder which tribe he belongs to.  I almost\\nsnort.\\nHe tips his chin at me. “How’ s the water out there?”\\n“Cold.”\\nHe dives in, submer ging completely and heading straight for me. He\\npops up, splashing and smoothing his hair back, grinning.\\nI start moving of f to the side so I can swim around him and get out.\\n“Relax,” he tells me. “Not everything with a penis is a threat.”\\n“Which is exactly what someone with a penis would say .”\\n“You’re Tiernan, right?” he says. And then cocks his head. “Terrance\\nHolcomb.”\\nI pause, treading water . “I thought you all went to ride bikes.”\\nHe smiles. “They went to ride. I snuck of f.”\\n“You followed me.” He must ’ve overheard me say I wanted to go for a hike when we were\\nall back at the house and guessed I’d wind up here? I start swimming for the\\nshore.\\n“If you go,” he says, “I don’t know if I’ll be able to get you alone\\nagain.” I turn my head, looking at him. “They’re very protective of their\\nproperty .”\\nI stop and face him, my feet touching the ground now. “I’m not their\\nproperty .”\\n“Everything on their property is their property .” He circles me, the\\nwater coming up to both our shoulders. “They live by different rules up\\nhere, T iernan.”\\nAs much as I’d like to argue with him, I think Jake, Noah, and Kaleb\\nwould agree with him. Jake’ s warning about local guys. Kaleb sending me\\nback in the house instead of letting me join them on the motorcycles. Noah\\nand his possessiveness in town yesterday .\\n“What do you want?” I ask him, changing the subject.\\n“You’re Chapel Peak’ s shiny new toy,” he tells me. “Just checking you\\nout.”\\nI raise my eyebrows.\\n“Yeah, that sounded cheesier than I thought it would,” he mumbles.\\n“Sorry .”\\n“Why?” I reply . “Toys are meant to be played with.”\\nHis mouth drops open, and we stare at each other as the loaded words\\nhangs between us.\\nAnd then, as if on cue, we both start laughing at the same time.\\n“That had extra cheese,” he teases.\\nYeah.\\nBut you seemed a little hopeful for a second ther e.\\nNeither of us make a move to get out, just continue to tread water and\\ncircle each other slowly .\\n“See any alligators yet?” he asks.\\nI narrow my eyes. “Huh?”\\n“In the pond,” he explains. “W e have some in here, you know?”\\nOh?\\n“No, actually , they left,” I tell him. “I did see some unicorns, though.”\\nHe chuckles, knowing it will take more than that to mess with me.\\n“Very good,” he says. “My ex totally fell for that one. She was so dumb she thought the District of Columbia was America’ s new state.”\\nI slide my hand s through the water, my body drifting back out into the\\npond again and him inching, getting closer .\\nHis eyes zone in, intense as they calmly watch me, and my stomach\\nflips. I know what he wants. W ill he feel like Kaleb did?\\n“Do you have a boyfriend?” he asks, his deep voice almost a whisper .\\n“Do you care?”\\nHe smirks. “I think you need one.”\\nPlease. Judging from the look in his eyes, he wouldn’ t care if I were\\nmarried.\\nAnd I’m not looking for an attachment. Maybe the Van der Bergs are\\nright in how they live. They get what they need when they need  it, and they\\ndon’t have to be held accountable, because they may as well live on the far\\nside of the moon for six months out of the year. No woman—no sane\\nperson—wants that life. Perfect situation for them.\\nMaybe me, too.\\n“They go to town every Friday night,” Terrance tells me, inching closer .\\n“To have some fun.”\\nI smile to myself. They don’t need to go to town for that. Town comes\\nto them.\\n“They always get the prettiest ones, too,” he goes on. “Until now. The\\nprettiest one they’ll keep home and to themselves, won’ t they?”\\nI tense. He comes in closer , but I don’ t back away .\\n“What if I were to come up here Friday night when you’re alone?” he\\nsays low . “Would you let me in the house?”\\nHis body  is so close, and I fist my hands in the water , because there’ s an\\nache low in my belly that won’ t go away , and maybe I should act. Maybe I\\nshould do something I would never, because I want to feel and because the\\nache has been there since my first morning here and the horseback ride.\\n“Would you want to have some fun of your own?” T errance taunts.\\nI swallo w, letting my imagination wander for a split-second. We could\\ndo it now, I guess. Right here, on the beach. Probably for hours before\\nanyone came to find me.\\nThe guys get their fun. Why shouldn’ t I?\\nI’ll never see this man after I leave, anyway .\\nHe swim s into me, backing me up and walking into me. When I get\\nonly waist deep, he wraps an arm around my waist and pulls me in. I plant my hands on his chest. No.\\nHis eyes drop, and he smiles at what he sees, and I look down, noticing\\nmy breasts visible through my wet bra, my nipples hard, little points.\\nI pull my arms up, covering myself.\\nUnlike last night when I couldn ’t even summon the will to stop Kaleb’ s\\nmouth.\\nTerrance takes my face and pulls me in, but before I can pull away ,\\nmotorcycles whir from somewhere in the trees, and we both jerk our heads\\ntoward the sound.\\nKaleb and Noah race up and stop just above the rocks, Noah\\nimmediately kicking down the stand and jumping of f.\\n“Get the fuck out of there!” he growls at me. “Now!”\\nI jump.\\nNoah heads down to me, and I look over, seeing Kaleb climbing off his\\nbike with a…\\nA… gun?\\nIs he kidding?\\nKaleb stands by his bike, staring at Terrance with his head tilted and his\\nexpression calm. A shotgun hangs casually at his side in his hand.\\nA shotgun.\\nThey’re all out of their minds.\\nI scramble out of the pond, dripping wet as I grab my backpack and\\nshirt off the ground. But as I dive back down for the rifle, Noah  snatches it\\nup and takes my wrist, pulling me after him. I stumble over the rocks.\\n“Jesus fucking Christ,” Terrance  whines behind me, and I look back to\\nsee him walking out of the wate r with his arms outstretched at his sides in a\\nchallenge to my cousins. “What are you gonna do with that, Kaleb? Huh?”\\nHe grins as Kaleb loads a shell.\\nShit.\\nNoah pulls me to his bike to climb on behind him. “Get on now .”\\nBut T errance pipes up again, and I hesitate.\\n“You’re not gonna be able to keep her to yourself,” he tells Kaleb and\\nNoah. “She’ s the prettiest thing we’ve all seen in a while, and I’m just\\ntrying to get in there before all the dogs start barking at your front door for\\na piece of that sweet little snatch.”\\nI cringe and Kaleb cocks his gun.\\n“Now , Tiernan!” Noah barks. And I climb on, hugging my backpack and shirt with one hand and\\nholding onto Noah with the other .\\nNoah starts the bike and turns it around as I hear Terrance ’s voice\\nbehind me. “See you soon, T iernan.”\\nAnd Noah races of f, taking us back down the mountain.\\nBut as we speed  away , I look behind me one more time and catch sight\\nof Kaleb still standing in the same spot. Staring at Terrance as he clutches\\nthe gun at his side.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nWe haul ass back to the house, Noah screeching to a halt next to his father ’s\\ntruck. I crash into him as the rear tire lifts of f the ground.\\nWhat the hell is the matter with them? As soon as the bike lands again, I\\njump of f and head for the house.\\nBut Noah is quick behind me, grabbing my wrist again.\\nI jerk away . “Get of f.”\\n“Where were you?” Jake demands, walking over to us.\\nBut I keep walking, slipping the flannel back on to cover myself. “I\\nneed a shower .”\\nI did nothing wrong.\\nJake doesn’ t let me pass, though . He clutches my upper arm, demanding\\nan answer .\\n“I need a shower ,” I tell him again, slowly twisting out of his hold.\\nHe towers over me, and I look up at him.\\n“What the hell would’ve happened if we hadn’ t found you?” Noah bites\\nout.\\n“What do you think would’ve happened?”\\n“You both looked pretty close,” he points out. Then he looks to his\\nfather . “She was up at the lake with Holcomb.”\\n“I told you to stay away from the local boys,” Jake tells me.\\nI shake my head , my backpack clutched in my fist. “I went for a hike,” I\\nexplain in a hard voice. “I didn’ t invite him. He showed up. Are we done?”\\nAnd then I glare at Noah. “I mean, Kaleb and the rifle? Really?” I spin around, walking for the house again.\\n“You left the rifle on the beach!” Noah growls at me. “You left yourself\\nunprotected.”\\n“What do you think he was going to do?” I ask, spinning around.\\n“Attack me?”\\nNoah’ s jaw flexes, and I can’ t help myself.\\n“He might not have had to,” I tell him, slipping my backpack over my\\nshoulder . “I was kind of liking him.”\\nHe adva nces like he’s going to come after me, but Jake shoots out his\\nhands and stops him, holding him back. I almost smile.\\nMy uncle turns, his patience gone. “Go get your shower ,” he orders me.\\nI turn and head up the stairs, hearing Noah’ s angry bark behind me.\\n“You’re a Van der Berg here,” he shouts. “If you give that assho le a piece of\\nass, I swear to God I’ll make sure you don’ t sit for a week.”\\n \\n \\nNoah.\\nCalm, pleasant, happy Noah.\\nWhat a surprise. And an asshole.\\nThe horse shuffles on her feet as I brush her rust-colored coat. It’s\\nmeditative, like cooking. The long, smooth strokes. My earbuds are in, but\\nno music plays, because I forgot to turn on my playlist when I came into the\\nbarn an hour ago.\\nI brush with one hand and follow  it with a stroke of the other , giving the\\ngirl lots of attention. I like animals.\\nAnd Colorado. It was actually nice today . Getting out there into the\\nwoods.\\nIt wasn’ t even so bad when the Holcomb guy showed up. Of course, he\\nwas an ass. I wasn’ t delusional. He’d screw me and brag and never speak to\\nme again unless he wanted more, but…\\nI don’ t know .\\nHe joked with me, and I joked back. There was no illusion about what\\nhe wanted. I didn’ t have to play games or pretend.\\nAnd part of me wanted it to be that easy. To not have to bond in order to\\nconnect.\\nYeah, I was tempted. I can’t talk right or say the right things, but maybe I can be soft and\\nsweet and happy in bed. Maybe I could be loving there.\\nMy eyes sting with tears, but I blink them away as I brush Shawnee’ s\\nmane.\\nThey hate me, I hate me, and I hate them.\\nNo, I stop and think, I don’t hate them. I just know I’ll fail. I can’t\\nconnect.\\nLeaving the stall, I toss the brush on the table with the other grooming\\ntools, and walk back through the shop, toward the house. I kick off my\\nmuddy rain boots but keep my black hoodie on as I open the door to the\\nkitchen and walk in. The afternoon is cooling of f, and I feel rain in the air .\\nI hear a hiss as I enter . “That fuckin’ prick…”\\nI turn to close the door, but I take a quick glance. Kaleb is planted on\\nthe table, his nose bloody and his father trying to clean it up, but he grabs\\nthe rag out of his dad’s hand and holds it to his nose himself. His lips are\\netched into a snarl.\\nDid Terrance Holcomb do that to him? I was a little worried about the\\nshotgun Kaleb had, but I suspec ted it was all for show . No polic e were here,\\nafter all.\\nNoah opens and closes the refrigerator , pulling out an ice pack, and I\\nwalk through the kitchen, toward the stairs.\\n“Get started on dinner ,” Jake tells me as I pass.\\n“I’m not hungry .”\\n“We are,” he grits out.\\nI stop and turn my head, the two of them crowded around Kaleb, and I\\nnotice the array of other scratch es, dirt, and blood on his jaw, shoulder , and\\nhip. A pang of guilt hits me, but the other guy probably looks worse, and I\\ndidn’ t ask Kaleb to do this for me.\\n“That’ s not my problem,” I shoot back, glaring at my uncle. “You want\\na servant, hire one.”\\nHe jerks his head toward me.\\n“And since I won’ t do what I’m told,” I add, “send me home.”\\nI don’t belong here. This is why I’m better alone. I don’t have to feel all\\nthese things all the time. Emba rrassment, shame, guilt… If you don’t put\\nyourself out there, you don’ t hurt.\\nNoah and Jake just stand there for a moment, and I look to Kaleb,\\nunable to stop myself. “I don’ t feel bad for you one bit,” I tell him. “Y ou got what you deserved, because you used me as an excuse to start a fight. You\\nweren’ t defending my honor .”\\nHe glares at me.\\n“Like any troglodyte male, you’re just dying to hit somethi ng. You\\nenjoyed yourself.”\\nHe hops off the table, leveling me with his eyes as he takes a couple\\nsteps forward like he’ s going to come at me.\\nBut Jake advances first. “You don’t know us,” he states. “You don’t\\ncome here and disrespect my home.”\\n“I’ve been here three days, and you have intimidated me, threatened me,\\nand taunted me. You’ve acted like bullies,” I tell them. “Isn’ t this what you\\nwanted? For me to yell? Fight? Isn’ t that what you said?”\\n“I said you’d benefit from some time here, and I was right!” Jake fires\\nback. “You’ve got no idea how to work inside of a unit. Be part of a team.\\nA family .”\\nHe stalk s forward, and I back into the living room as he closes the\\ndistance between  us. “Let me educate you, girl,” he growls. “You’re the kid.\\nI’m the adult. You do as you’re  told, and there’ s no problem. That system\\nworks for us.” He towers over me. “Just. Do. As. Y ou’re. T old!”\\nI shrink  for a second, but then I shake my head, muttering, “You’re\\nimpossible.”\\n“And you’re spoiled.”\\nI drop my head, squeezing my eyes shut against his attack. I’ve never\\nbeen yelled at before. Ever. That fact just occurs to me, and my hands are\\nshaking.\\nIt’s degrading. I feel like shit.\\n“No maids here,” he continues, “No butlers.”\\nMy back hits the wall as I grind my teeth together and anger burns in\\nmy gut.\\nHe goes on, “No assistants to wipe your fucking little ass. No easy\\naccess to your psychiatrist to get you your pills that you need to dull the\\npain of how shallow your life is!”\\n“That’ s your baggage!” I shout, finally looking up at him and giving it\\nback. “Y our issues with our family are not my problem!”\\nWhat do I care about maids, butlers, or pills? He’s bringing his personal\\nshit into this. “Is anything your problem?” he retorts. “Do you give a shit about\\nanyone but yourself? You don’t ask us questions about our lives. You barely\\neat with us. Y ou won’ t sit with us. Y ou have no interest in who we are!”\\n“Because I’m always in the kitchen!” I blurt up at him, my chest nearly\\nbrushing his.\\n“You’re a brat,” he breathes out, seething. “A self-absorbed, snobby ,\\nlittle brat!”\\n“I’m not! I’m just…”\\nI stop myself, scowling and looking away . Goddammit. Goddamn him.\\nI’m not a brat. I’m…\\n“You’re just what?” he demands. “Huh?”\\nI’m not spoiled.  Tears burn my eyes, and my chin shakes. I don’t care\\nabout luxury . Or money . I’m not unfriendly because they live here and live\\ndifferently . That’ s not it. I’m just…\\n“Just what?” he shouts again. “So quiet now , aren’ t you?”\\n“Dad…” Noah says somewhere from the kitchen.\\nBut I can’t see him. My uncle crowds me, and I can’t stop the tears from\\npooling.\\n“I’m not…”\\nI swallow , no idea what to say. No idea what my problem is. He’s right,\\nright? Any polite—normal—person would be able to converse casually .\\nEngage in small talk. Ask them questions. Smile, joke around…\\nI shake my head , more to mysel f than him, murmuring, “I’m just… not\\nused to…”\\n“To what?” he bites out. “Rules? A spending limit? Small closet space?”\\nA tear falls, and it takes everything to keep the sob bottled up.\\n“Chores of any kind?” he contin ues. “What is so godawful different in\\nthis house compared to yours? What are you so not used to?”\\n“People,” I blurt out.\\nI don’ t know when I figured it out, but it just comes out.\\nHe’s right. I have no idea how to be with people.\\nTears fall, spilling down my face as I stare at the floor .\\n“I’m not used to people,” I whisper . “They don’ t talk to me at home.”\\nHe doesn’t speak, and I can’t hear the boys making any movements\\neither , the silence making the room feel smaller .\\nI raise my eyes,  no longer carin g that he can see my red eyes and wet\\nface. “No one talks to me.” And before he can say anything , I run up the stairs, desperate to get in\\nmy bedroom and away from their eyes. I lock the door and fall back on the\\nbed, covering my eyes with my arms to stop the tears.\\nGod, why did I do that? What a fucking basket case. He’s going to send\\nme home now because I’m emotional and too much work.\\nI cry quietly into my arm.\\nI shouldn’ t have done that. I never fight with anyone, but I would fight\\nbefore I’d ever cry. It’s a weak person’ s tactic to end an argume nt. It’s not a\\nfair fight when someone starts blubbering.\\nAw, look at the poor, little rich girl. Her mommy and daddy let her have\\nanything she wanted, but they didn’ t hold her hand or kiss and hug her\\nevery day . Poor baby .\\nNow they’ll just see me as even less than they did before. Fragile. Easy\\nto break. A problem to tiptoe around.\\nHow many kids would’ve happily lived with my parents if it meant they\\nwere being fed and clothed every day? I have everything, and I just broke in\\nfront of them over nothing.\\nEveryone should be as lucky as I am.\\n \\n“Can you believe it?” I hear d my mother shout.\\n“Oh, come on,” my father chuckled. “W e knew it was going to happen.”\\nI slowly stepped into my father ’s study , seeing my father and Mirai both\\nsmiling, and my mom with her hands palm to palm in front of her chest as\\nshe giggled.\\nThen she r eached out and wrapped her arms ar ound my father .\\nI smile. “What’ s going on?” I asked softly , inching into the r oom.\\nBut they’r e only looking at each other .\\nMirai glanced at me and smiled wider . “Your mom—\\nBut my father ’s voice interrup ts. “I need to call Tom,” he told my\\nmother , rounding  his desk. “All the promo needs to be changed for the new\\nmovie.”\\nI looked between them, coming  to stand in front of the sofa, so they\\ncould see me.\\n“Oscar -nominated actress Amelia de Haas,” my father recites as if\\nreading a billboar d.\\nMy mouth fell open, and I smiled wide. “Oscar?”\\nReally? That’ s amazing. “Well, no,” my mother teased, still focused on my dad. “What if I win?\\nThen it’ s Oscar -winning  actress. Y ou better hold off.”\\nMy father laughed again and came back around the desk, kissing her.\\n“My wife.”\\nThey looked at each other , their eyes lit with excitement and bliss, and I\\nstepped ar ound, trying to catch their eyes as I appr oached.\\nI wanted to hug my mom and congratulate her. I wanted her to know I\\nwas pr oud of her\\n“Mom…”\\n“Go make some  calls,” she told Mirai, not hearing me. “You know what\\nto do,”\\nMirai’ s eyes met mine, the always-pr esent pity still there, and then she\\ncast a r egretful look at my par ents befor e she left the r oom quietly .\\n“Congratulations,” I said as I approached, keeping the smile on my\\nface.\\nBut my mom already moved away . “Alright, let’s get to Jane’ s office,”\\nshe told my dad. “I’ll need to put in a statement.”\\n“I’m so pr oud of you, honey ,” he said.\\nAnd they both left, taking the noise and excitement with them. Like I was\\na shadow . A ghost who walked their halls but wasn’ t seen or hear d.\\nI stood there, watching them  as they tread down the hall and\\ndisappear ed around a corner . I clasped my hands in front of me, trying to\\npush away the lump that lodged in my thr oat.\\nI was happy for her. I wanted her to know that she was stunnin g, and I\\nloved her movies.\\nI wanted her to know that.\\nWhy did she never want to share the wonderful things that happ ened in\\nher life with me, because she was the first place I wanted to run to as a\\nchild to tell her when a wonderful thing had happened to me.\\nBefor e I stopped trying.\\nI stood ther e, staring off.  It’s okay .\\nIt wasn ’t about me. This was her day. I had no right to demand\\nattention.\\nI heard the front door slam close d, the house, and everything in it, going\\nstill and silent.\\nLike nothing lived her e.\\nLike, when they left, nothing did.  \\nI blink my eyes awake, already blurry with tears. I sit up and swing my\\nlegs over the side, bowing my head and taking some deep breaths.\\nIt’s early morning. I can tell by the blue hue of the light coming in\\nthrough my balcony doors.\\nA tear catches on my lip, and I wipe it off with my hand . I still\\nremember so many little things , growing up with them, that would never\\nseem terrible on their own, but after years of conversations I felt like I was\\ninterrupting, occasions I wasn’ t invited or welcome to, and affection that\\nwas so easily doled out between them that didn’ t stretch to me…  It all hurt.\\nEverything hurt, and it kept piling up year after year until I stopped letting\\nmyself care anymore.\\nOr stopped showing that I cared.\\nI let out a sigh, tilting my head back, but then something catches my\\neye, and I look over, seeing a white bag on top of my bedside table. I\\nnarrow my eyes and reach over, picking up the worn paper sack that no\\nlonger felt crisp and new .\\nIs this…?\\nThe bundle at the bottom of the bag fits in the palm of my hand, and I\\ncan smell the cinnamon bears before I even open it.\\nHow did this get back in here? I threw the whole bag of candy out.\\nBut now , black writing covers the front, and slowly , I unfold the bag and\\nfind a ray of light near me, reading the words.\\nYour par ents never gave you anything sweet. That’ s why you’r e not.\\nI look over to my bedroom door, noticing it’s opened a crack. I’d closed\\nand locked it when I went to bed.\\nThoughts wash over me, but my heart isn’t beating fast. I should be\\nmad. Someone came in here while I was asleep. Someone went through my\\ntrash.\\nSomeone is trolling me on a paper bag.\\nBut he’ s not wrong. I rub my thumb over the letters.\\nThe way it’ s written. That’ s why you’r e not. It’s so childish but simple.\\nStanding up, I dump the content s back into the trash, but I save the bag,\\nflattening it out and laying it on my chest of drawers. I don’t know if\\nblaming my parents is a good enough reason for being such a miserable\\nfucking person, but someone in this world gets me, and I’m not even offended they said I wasn’ t sweet. I know I’m not, and someone\\nunderstands why .\\nLeaving the room, I head down stairs, the wind in the trees surrounding\\nthe house like a perpetual waterfall in the background. I veer into the\\nkitchen, quietly stepping to the sink to fill up a glass of water .\\nI stare out the window , the feathers on the chickens in the coop\\nfluttering in the morning breeze.\\nI don’t want to go home. But I don’t want to stay here and be noticed,\\neither , because their world is just a little worse with me in it. I’m not Jake\\nVan der Ber g’s problem.\\nI don’t even realize I’ve started to put the coffee filter in the machine\\nuntil a hand reaches out and gently takes the package from me.\\nLooking up, I see my uncle. He stands next to me, emptying  coffee\\ngrounds into the filter , and I expect him to still be tense. Fuming. In a bad\\nmood, at least, because I’m too much trouble.\\nBut he’s calm. And quiet. He scoops the coffee out of the bag and\\nempties it into the machine, quietly closes the lid, and turns on the pot.\\nA gurgling sound starts as it begins to brew , and he picks up a coffee\\nmug from the rack and sets it in front of himself.\\n“I’m going to go home,” I say quietly .\\n“You are home.” He sets a mug in front of me.\\nMy chin trembles a little.\\nI turn my head away , not wanting him to see me cry again, but then I\\nfeel his fingers brush my hair behind my ear, and the gesture makes my\\neyes fall closed. It feels so good I want to fucking cry again.\\nWithout waiting another secon d, he pulls me into him, wrapping his\\narms around me and holds my head to his chest.\\nI empty my lungs, my arms hanging limply at my sides, becaus e I can’t\\nbring myself to return the embra ce, but I don’t pull away either . His T-shirt-\\nclad chest is warm against my cheek, and his familiar smell drifts into my\\nhead, lulling my tears to a calm.\\nI’ve been hugged a lot. More than I like, actually . It seems to be a thing\\nnow. Females—complete strangers—come in for hugs as a greeting.\\nAcquaintances embrace. People  you run into on the street dive in all the\\nfucking time like we’re all oh-so-close besties, even though they’re barely\\ntouching you.\\nI hate the fake af fection. But this is dif ferent.\\nHe’s holding onto me. Like, if he doesn’ t, I might fall.\\nMuscles I didn’ t know I had start to relax, and his lips touch the top of\\nmy head, a warm  tingle spreading over my body . It’s warm, like something\\nI’m dying to crawl inside and just go to sleep.\\nWhy was this so hard for my parents? It wasn’ t unnatural for me to want\\nthis from  them. It wasn’ t. To want to share my life with people who love\\nme. T o laugh and cry and make memories together .\\nBecause life is only happy when it’ s shared.\\nTears hang on my lashes, and the sudden urge to hold onto him starts to\\nwind through me.\\nI don’ t want to be alone anymore.\\nI don’ t want to go home where I’m alone.\\nHis whisper tickles my scalp. “Everyone’ s going through shit, Tiernan.”\\nHe pauses as the steady rise and fall of his chest lulls me. “Y ou’re not alone.\\nDo you understand that?”\\nHe tips my chin up, and I look up at him, nearly losing my breath at his\\nwarm eyes that stare right through me.\\n“You’re not alone,” he whispers again.\\nMy eyes drop to his lips, and for a moment, I’m with him, breathing\\nwith him and my blood coursing hot under my skin as I take in his tanned\\nface, smooth mouth, and the rugged scruf f along his jaw .\\nI have a sudden urge to wrap my arms around him and hide in his neck,\\nbut he runs his thumb over my jaw. The heat under my skin spreads lower ,\\nand the small smile he had on his lips fades as he stares down at me.\\nFinally he blinks, breaking the spell as he drops his hand. “Get dressed,\\nokay?” he asks. “Pants and a long-sleeved shirt. You’re with me this\\nmorning.”\\nReleasing me, he pours the coffee while the morning chill hits me, and\\nall I can wish is that he was still holding me.\\nBut my heart warms anyway . I’m with him this morning. I tread upstairs\\nand pull on a pair of clean jeans and some socks.\\nAfter pulling my hair up, I hesitate for a moment and then knock on\\nNoah’ s door . The last time he spoke to me he threatened to spank me.\\nAfter a few knocks I hear his hard footfalls on the floor .\\nHe swings open the door, looki ng hungover and propping one hand on\\nthe doorframe, the other on the door like he’ s trying to hold himself up. I’m not apologizing. But I don’ t really expect one from him, either .\\n“May I borrow a long-sleeved shirt?” I ask.\\nHe nods and turns around, closing his eyes as he yawns. “Yeah, go for\\nit.”\\nI walk in and find his closet, the door hanging open and a flannel\\nalready there in front of me.\\n“Fuckin’ early ,” he gripes. “Does he want me up yet?”\\n“He didn’ t say.”\\n“Cool,” he mumbles and crashes back down on his bed, face first.\\nHe’s still wearin g his jeans from  yesterday , and I look around his room,\\nseeing an array of discarded clothes, shoes, and other odds and ends strewn\\nabout. Messy but not really dirty .\\nTaking the shirt,  I leave the room, closing the door behind me, and wrap\\nit around my waist, tying it. Turning to walk down the stairs, I hear\\nsomething behind me, and look over to see Kaleb coming down the third-\\nfloor staircase.\\nHe veers for the bathroom, and even though I’m less than six feet away ,\\nhe prete nds he doesn’ t notice me and disappears into the room, slamming\\nthe door behind him.\\nI linger a moment. I could barely  see the cuts on his face from yesterday\\nin the dark hallway , but I could definitely see the one on his lip.\\nIt’s not my fault he got into a fight. But still…\\nWalking over to the door, I raise my hand to knock but then stop myself.\\nI lean my ear in, but I don’ t hear anything, and I struggle to walk away .\\nI have ointment…for his cuts…if he wants.\\nI…\\nOh, never mind . I close my fist and finally drop my hand, turning to\\nleave.\\nI head downstairs, spotting Jake outside on the deck, and walk out,\\njoining him. He hands me a mug of coffee and stares out at the forest and\\nthe mist that hangs around the trunks.\\n“I like getting up early ,” he tells me. “It’s the only time the house and\\nland are quiet, and I have the ener gy to enjoy it.”\\nI look up at him. Me, too. Taking a sip of my coffee, I force the words\\nout, even though my instinct tells me to be quiet. I want to make an ef fort.\\n“I like that you all work at home,” I tell him, seeing him look at me out\\nof the corner of my eye. “There’ s always people here.” People who are a little abrasiv e, rude, and over-bearing, but I have a\\ncouple of those undesirable qualities myself.\\nHe half-smiles down at me, and I drink some more of my coffee before\\nsetting the mug down on the railing.\\n“Come on,” he says, setting his down, too.\\nWalking around  me, he leads me down the stairs and toward the barn,\\npicking up a tool belt from the worktable in the shop as we pass by .\\nWe walk beyond the stable to the paddock where Bernadette and\\nShawnee are already wandering and getting some fresh air .\\nI stare at the back of his head as I follow him and he buckles on his tool\\nbelt.\\nQuestions. He mentioned I never asked them questions.\\nIt’s not that I don’ t have questions, but questions start conversations.\\n“Hold this up for me,” he asks, lifting a piece of the fencing around the\\ncorral.\\nI come in and lean down, lifting up the board so it’s level as he dips\\nthrough the opening in the fence  to the other side. Pulling out a hammer and\\nnail, he bolts the board back in place as I help hold on.\\n“Why doesn’ t Kaleb talk?” I ask.\\nHe doesn’ t look at me as he pulls out another nail and starts pounding.\\n“I’m not sure I should talk about it, if Kaleb won’ t.”\\n“Does it have to do with their mother?”\\nHis eyes shoot up to me. “What do you know about their mother?”\\nI shrug . “Nothin g, really ,” I say. “But the boys obviously came from\\nsomewhere and not from the twenty-five-year -olds leaving your room every\\nmorning.”\\nHe chuckles, pounding in the nail. “It’ s not every morning, thank you.”\\nBut she is twenty-five. Or younger , because he didn’ t correct me on the\\nage.\\nThe silence hangs in the air, and his expression grows pensive as he fits\\nanother nail.\\n“Their mother is in prison,” he states. “T en to fifteen up in Quintana.”\\nQuintana.\\nTen to fifteen…years?\\nI stare at my uncle who’ s not making eye contact, a whole bundle of\\nquestions now ready to pour out. What did she do? W as he involved?\\nDo Noah and Kaleb still talk to her? He moves down the line, and I follow him, noticing another board\\nkicked of f.\\nWhen was she sentenced? How long has he been raising the boys by\\nhimself?\\nI soften my eyes, watching him. That must’ve been hard. It’s a different\\npain, I’m sure. Having someone taken away from you versus someone\\nwanting to leave you.\\n“You loved her?” I ask.\\nBut then I drop my eyes, embarrassed. Of course, he loved her .\\n“I dove  into her,” he explains instead. “Because I couldn’ t stop loving\\nsomeone else.”\\nI narrow my eyes.\\nHe stops and pulls out his wallet, opening it up and taking out a\\nsnapshot.\\nHe hands it to me.\\nI look down at it, recognizing him instantly and smiling a little.\\nIt’s actually not a snapshot. It’s a Polaroid with a sharp crease down the\\nmiddle and faded faces staring back.\\nHe lays there, on a picnic blanket, no shirt and long khaki  shorts,\\nhugging a dark-eyed girl to his body , her midnight hair splayed out behind\\nher.\\nHe’s pale and a lot scrawnier than what he is now, but he has that same\\nsmile that looks like he’s either laughing at you on the inside  or thinking\\nthings that are only suitable to do behind closed doors. But with a preppy\\nhaircut and baby face that make s him look like he should be the douchebag\\nquarterback on a CW show .\\n“You?” I look up at him, trying to hide my amusement.\\nHe snatches the picture back, frowning at me. “I was quite the belle of\\nthe ball back in the day , you know?”\\nWas? Seems he still is.\\nHe grabs a shov el and starts packing dirt back into the hole where the\\nfence post stands.\\n“Your grandpa had a house in Napa Valley ,” he says as I hold the post\\nupright for him. “We’d go up there in the summer , play golf, get drunk,\\nfuck around…”\\nWe… My father , too? I barely remember my grandfat her, since he died when I was six, but I\\nknow he divorced his first wife—my dad’s mother—when my dad was\\nabout twelve, and chose another Dutch woman for his secon d wife. She\\nalready had a son of her own—Jake.\\n“I was eighteen, and I met Flora,” my uncle continues. “God, she was\\nfucking beautifu l. Her family worked on a vineyard. Immigrant. Poor….”\\nHe glances at me. “And, of course, our families couldn’ t have that.”\\nI almost have the urge to laugh, not because it’s funny , but becau se I get\\nit. For the first time, I realize Jake and I are part of the same family , and he\\nknows them as well as I do.\\n“She didn’t have a swimsuit,” he mused. “All summer , I remember . It\\ndidn’ t even occu r to me she couldn’ t afford one, because I loved that she\\nswam in her underwear and undershirt when we went to the lake. Her body\\nwas so beautiful, the way the wet clothes stuck to her .”\\nI picture  him, his hormones and emotions raging. What’ s he like when\\nhe’s in love?\\nHe sighs . “It was sexier than any bikini. I never wanted that summer to\\nend. W e couldn’ t stay of f each other . I was totally gone for her .”\\nBut she’ s not here now .\\n“One night your mother…”\\n“My mother?” I dart my eyes up to him.\\nBut he’ s avoiding my gaze, and his lips are tight.\\n“Your mother was a rising star, and your parents had just started\\ndating,” he explains. “She took Flora out and got her drunk, and when Flora\\nwoke up, she was in bed with another man.” He finally looked over at me,\\npausing in his work. “Another man who wasn’ t me.”\\nMy mother took her out, got her drunk, and…\\n“My father ,” I say , putting the pieces together .\\nJake nods. “Your grandfather knew I wasn’ t going to let her go, so your\\nparents helped get rid of her .”\\nI blink long and hard. I can’t believe I defended them to my uncle. To\\nhim. No wonder he hates them.\\n“She felt so guilty, thinking she’d had sex with another man,” Jake\\ncontinued, leading me into the stable to fill the horses’ food, “it was a piece\\nof cake for the family to convin ce her our relationship was over unless she\\nwanted me to find out what she’d done. ‘And hey, here’ s fifty grand to\\ncover moving expenses. Disappear , kid. Don’ t call him.’” “You never tried to find her?”\\n“I did,” he tells me. “I found her in some apartment in San Francisco.”\\nHe falls silent for a moment as he pulls on his gloves. “She wouldn’ t\\neven let me through the door,” he says. “Couldn’ t look me in the eye. Said\\nshe couldn’ t see me anymore and didn’ t want me to call.”\\nHe cuts open the hay bales, and I take a rake and start to spread it\\naround the stall.\\n“When did you find out what they really did to her?” I ask him.\\nHe remains quiet for a moment, and when he finally speaks, his voice is\\nalmost a whisper . “About a week after I left her apartment and her sister\\ncalled to tell me she’d died.”\\nDied?\\nI stop. “Suicide?”\\nHe nods and continues working.\\n“Oh, my God.”\\n“And six hours after that, I packed a bag and never looked back,” he\\ntells me, giving me a tight smile. “Got on the road, planned to head to\\nFlorida, but I got here and…never wanted to leave.” His eyes soften, and\\nthings I thought I knew start to melt away as the pieces of the puzzle come\\ntogether .\\n“I moved onto this land with a run-down trailer and no indoor\\nplumbing. Now  I have a house, a shop, a business, and my sons. Things\\nturned out far better for me than I deserved.”\\nWhy would he think he didn’ t deserve what he had? It wasn’ t his fault.\\nHe tried to find her. If they wanted to get to her, they were going to get to\\nher.\\nMy parents. Would they have intervened like that if I’d fallen  in love\\nwith someone who didn’ t fit the image?\\n“I’m sorry ,” I rush out. “I’m sorry they did that—”\\n“Your parents, Tiernan,” he says, cutting me off and looking me in the\\neye. “Not your fault.”\\nIt’s hard to make sense of, though. My mother wasn’ t so different than\\nFlora. Just as poor, but at least Flora had a family . My mother  had been a\\nfoster kid with no one. How could she not be on the girl’ s side?\\nI drop my eyes to Jake’ s waist, the tattoo he sports on the side covered\\nby his T-shirt now, but I remember the words. My Mexico . He said Flora was an immigra nt, so is the tattoo for her? Or how cowboys escaped across\\nthe border back in the day , Colorado became his escape? His Mexico.\\n“We need to have some fun,” he chirps, lightening the mood with a\\nsmile. “Let’ s all go up to the lake tomorrow .”\\nThe lake? Not the pond?\\n“Get some music and beer in us,” he goes on. “Some clif f diving.”\\n“Clif f diving?”\\nHis eyes fall briefly down my body . “You have a swimsuit, right?”\\nBut the question sounds more like a warning, because he doesn’ t damn\\nwell want me swimming in my clothes like yesterday .\\nOr in my underwear like Flora.\\nYes, I have a…bikini. Dread coils through my stomach. I usually wear\\nwhatever our personal shopper buys without a care, but I think I’m going to\\ncare with them tomorrow .\\nWhy don’ t I have a one piece? Or a rash guard? Ugh…\\nOver the next couple of hours, I’m a demon, rushing from one task to\\nthe next, and glad for the distraction. Jake, Noah, and I finish morning\\nchores, I cook breakfast and Noah cleans up, and then I assist them in the\\nshop, typing out responses to emails that my uncle dictates concerning the\\nbusiness while he works.\\nJake and I load two bikes onto the flatbed, roping them down, before he\\nslips his T-shirt back on and pulls his keys out of his pocket. I know he\\nneeds to take them to town to deliver them to the transport, shipping them\\noff to wherever they’re going, but suddenly he stops and looks over my\\nshoulder .\\nI follow his gaze.\\nKaleb is at the other end of the barn, jeans hanging loosely from his\\nhips, no shirt, and the sun shinin g across his bare chest, which is damp with\\nsweat, as he brings the ax down and chops a log in two.\\nHe rubs his jaw across his shoulder , blood from his open wounds\\nspreading across his cheek.\\n“Go grab the First Aid kit,” Jake tells me as he starts to walk for the\\ndriver ’s side. “Kaleb needs help.”\\n“Yeah, professional help,” I grumble. “He…”\\nIt’s on the tip of my tongue to tell him about the other night in the shop.\\nAnd about the barn yesterday . But…I can’t put all the blame on Kaleb, I guess. It’s best not to bring it\\nup.\\n“He threatened that guy with a gun yesterday ,” I say , instead.\\nKaleb scares me.\\nBut Jake turns around and charges right back to me. “That guy,” he tells\\nme, “has a clubhouse in town for gangbangs with a scoreboard on the wall,\\nrating each girl on a scale of one to ten. There are no less than three-\\nhundred names of all the tail he and his friends have bagged in their short\\nlives.” And then he points in my face, and I rear back a little, scowling.\\n“You’re fucking  lucky Kaleb found you and not me, because  I wouldn’ t\\nhave waited before you left before I fucking killed him.”\\nI cock an eyebrow but don’ t protest further .\\n“Now move your tush,” he orders.\\nHe turns around and climbs in the truck, and I drag my feet for another\\nminute after he drives off before walking into the barn and yanking the\\ndamn First Aid kit out of the cabinet.\\nHe doesn’ t want help from me. Not any more than I care to help him.\\nAnd I still don’t believe for one second he or Noah were trying to keep\\nme safe. Even though, assuming what Jake said is true, it’s good they did\\nshow up, actually .\\nBut, no. I think Terrance might  have been correct on that assessment.\\nThey’re territorial. It could’ve been any guy with their baby  cousin up\\nthere, and they would’ve been angry and started a fight.\\nTrudging over to where Kaleb is working, I stop, not wanting to make\\neye contact.\\nI hold up the kit to him. “Y ou’re bleeding.”\\nHe stares at me for a moment and then uses his shoulder to wipe the\\nblood again before picking up another log, ignoring me.\\nOpening the box, I take out the Neosporin. “The ointment will keep it\\nfrom tearing,” I say , calming my voice and trying. “Put the ointment on it.”\\nHe stops, his hesitant eyes going from me to the tube in my hand.\\nI ease my shoulders, forcing myself to relax. I don’ t want to fight today .\\n“Sit down,” I tell him softly . “Please.”\\nHis eyes narrow , and he doesn’ t move.\\nI gestur e to the tree stump, softening my voice to almost a whisper .\\n“Please sit down.”\\nHe waits a few seconds, staring at me, but then…he sits. Setting the box down, I take out an anti-bacterial wipe and move over to\\nhim, avoiding his eyes as I stand over him.\\nI clean off the blood on his face, gently wiping the scratches, as well,\\nbut I feel his eyes watching every move I make. They follow me as I lean\\ndown and pick at the dried blood and then rise up again to uncap the\\nointment. It doesn’ t feel like the other night when he wanted me. Now , it’s\\nlike he’ s scared of me. He’ s watching for a wrong move.\\nI swallo w. “Kee ping it moist will keep it from scabbing, and it’ll heal\\nquicker ,” I tell him, dabbing ointment on his jaw. “Keep reapplying this,\\nokay?”\\nI generously cover the entire length of the wound, blinking when the\\nsmell of soil, wood, and wet air hits me. He always seems to smell like that.\\nHe says nothing, his chest rising and falling with breaths too perfect and\\ncontrolled as if each one is an ef fort to stay calm.\\nHis fists are balled as they rest on his lap, and I glance at him, our eyes\\nmeeting. A shiver runs through me. I like that he’ s scared.\\nI get closer out of spite, dabbing far more ointment than he needs.\\n“You didn’ t shoot that guy yesterday , did you?” I joke.\\nI glance over , and he’ s still silently watching me.\\nBut to my surprise, there’ s amusement in his gaze.\\nMy heart skips, and my insides feel like a warm puddle. It’s not a smile,\\nbut it’ s soft. Like how I felt with him the other night for a few seconds. Like\\nI could sink into someone.\\nI clear my throa t and stand up. “Alright.” I recap the tube and hand it to\\nhim. “Here.”\\nHe takes it, not once blinking as he stares at me.\\n“Reapply before bed,” I tell him.\\nBut he doesn’ t nod or do anything that acknowledges he heard me\\nexcept continue to gawk.\\n“Lunch!” Noah calls.\\nI startle, looking across the yard to see him heading for the other truck.\\n“Wanna drive with me?” he asks. “I’m going to get cheesebur gers.”\\nI’m not sure if he’s talking to me or his brother , but I look back down at\\nKaleb and see him still looking at me.\\nAnd I’m not…confident about being left here alone with him.\\nI should go with Noah. “Coming,” I say, holding Kaleb ’s eyes as I walk away , the look he’s\\ngiving me telling me I’m right.\\nI shouldn’ t be left here alone with him.  \\n \\n \\nN o a h\\n \\nHer arm whips out, knocking pieces off my Harry Potter Wizard Chess\\nboard, some tumbling to the floor .\\nI wince.\\n“Noah, get up!” I hear my father  shout on the other side of my bedroom\\ndoor. His footfalls fade as he descends the stairs.\\nFuck.  The chick on top of me leans down, grabs the headboard, and\\nrolls her hips up and down my cock. Come on…  The hard flesh pulses with\\nheat, but I can’t seem to get there. I grip her hips, guiding her faster and\\nfaster .\\n“Am I hotter?” she gasps.\\n“Yeah.”\\n“And my tits?” She cradles the back of my neck, shoving her breast in\\nmy face. “Y ou like them better?”\\nI manage half an eye roll, but I give her nipple a bite for good measure.\\nShe does have nicer tits than Rory, but at least Rory knew what foreplay\\nwas. This chick trying to jump on my cock at six in the morning and\\nexpecting it to be immediately standing at attention is just downright\\noffensive.\\nLuckily , I was able to conjure a sordid memory from high school to get\\nme ready .\\nLeaning back up, she runs her hands over her body , squeezing her\\nbreasts as her blonde hair falls all around her. Then she slams the wall next\\nto the bed with her hand and groans in pleasure. Jesus, fuck. If T iernan wasn’ t awake in there, she is now .\\nI pull Remi’ s hand down from the wall and sit up, kissing her to shut up\\nher moaning. Being loud at night is one thing. Loud in the morning reminds\\neveryone I’m late for work, because I’m fucking my ex’s eighteen-year -old\\nsister in here.\\n“Noah!” my dad bellows again from downstairs.\\nYeah, yeah... Just come alr eady. Come on…\\nMy head swims. I’m not into this.\\nBut I don’t want to leave the room and deal with my father , either . I\\nmove my body faster , kissing her neck, pulling her hair, and fuck her from\\nthe bottom, her moans getting louder .\\nCome on, baby . Come.\\n“I love fucking you,” she croons.\\nI nod. Yeah, okay .\\n“I’m glad I got my turn up here.”\\nYour turn…\\n“Go hard,” she pants. “I’m daddy’ s little whore.”\\nEw. What the fuck? I close my eyes, my stomach rolling.\\n“You won’ t hurt me, Noah,” she says.\\nShhhhh…ut the fuck up.\\n“I dare you to try .”\\nThat’ s it. I grit my teeth and circle her waist, flipping us both around\\nand pinning her on her back. I cover her mouth with my hand as I push her\\nknees wide, spreading her open.\\nI fuck her hard and fast as my bed rocks, the floorboards creak, and I\\nstare out the window behind my headboard. I just want this to be over .\\nI clench  my jaw, the feel of her sweat making me feel like the walls are\\nclosing in. I want it of f me.\\nI close my eyes.\\nI need out of this room.\\nOut of this house.\\nOut of the woods.\\nOff the mountain.\\nI don’t care if I ever see another fucking tree in my life, because maybe\\nnow that I’ve fucked every woman within fifty miles and can’t look at\\nmyself in the mirror anymore, I’ve reached the end of my rope and won’ t be\\nso chicken shit that I can’ t stand up to my dad. Nights are better . When I’m tired, and I just want some ass before I go\\nto bed, but in the morning… I don’t wake up wanting to be where I am and\\nlooking forward to doing shit I don’ t want to do. I’m bored.\\nIn another minute, I feel her moans vibrate on my palm, her pussy\\ncontracts, squeezing my cock, and I grunt as I finish her off, forcing hard\\nbreaths in her ear , so she thinks I finished, too.\\nMy skin itches where it touches her .\\nI remove my hand.\\n“I love the feel of your cum inside me,” she breathes out.\\nI didn’ t come. And I’m wearing a condom, Dunder head.\\n“Noah!” And I hear the baseball bat hit the log column downsta irs. “Get\\nup!”\\nI wipe my face with my hands and roll of f Remi.\\nFucking prick. A cool sweat covers my body , and I stand up and pull off\\nthe condom, tossing it. I pull on my jeans as I throw her T-shirt to her, but I\\ncan feel her eyes on me as she sits up. I need some goddamn air and some\\nspace to wallow in my shame.\\nIf I can’t come even once, that’s unacceptable. I’m good in bed,\\ngoddammit. W omen leave my room happy .\\nNot like the Boulevard of Broken Dreams that’s my father ’s bed when\\nthey realize he only wants sex and not a relationship or Skid Row upstairs\\nin Kaleb’ s room where women are lucky to leave alive.\\nI, on the other hand, am really good at this shit.\\nRemi stares at me, a flirty smile on her lips like we’re supposed to make\\nplans for next time or something, but I just dip down and give her a quick\\npeck on the lips that hopefully says, “bye.”\\nAnd please, please be gone when I get back fr om the shower .\\nI turn around, grab a Bud from my little fridge, and leave the room,\\nshutting the door behind me.\\nI twist off the top and slide it into my pocket. I’m gonna need  a buzz\\nthis morning.\\nCarrying the beer across the hall, I hear footfalls to my right and look\\nover to see T iernan stomping up the stairs.\\nShe snif fles, not really looking sad but frustrated. “So nasty ,” she growls\\nto herself, her voice thick with a sob. “I have… like chicken shit under my\\nfingernails. So gross. Why is he so weird? Just buy your chicken at the store\\nlike everyone else, you know?” My snort almost escapes, but I keep quiet. She hasn’ t noticed me yet,\\nand I don’t want her to. She’s too damn funny , and I like watching her get\\npissed of f. My only little ray of sunshine in this big ol’ shithole.\\nAlthough, I do sympathize with her. Cleaning out the chicken coops is\\nno party .\\n“And it better be done good enough for him, because I’m not… ” And\\nshe breaks into air quotes, “doing it fifteen times until I get it right.” She\\nmimics my father ’s deep voice and dumbass alpha orders.\\nI laugh to mysel f, utterly delighted. Someone who hates him as much as\\nI do.\\nOkay , okay . I don’ t hate him. I just… hate myself.\\nShe heads for the bathroom, and I can’t stop myself as I rush over and\\ngrab the door handle before she can.\\n“There’ s another bathroom downstairs,” I tease, unable to keep myself\\nfrom fucking up her morning some more.\\n“I need the show er.” She scowls up at me, her eyes red but her mouth\\ntight. She sports cute French braids down both sides of her head and tries\\ngrabbing the handle from me.\\n“We’re going fishing,” I argue, shoving my body in front of hers in our\\nbattle for the door . “You’re just going to get dirty again.”\\nShe slaps my hand. “I was here first!” And then she yanks at my arms\\nand shoves at my chest. “If you have to piss, then you do it downstairs.”\\n“I need a shower , too.”\\n“Why?” she mocks, repeating my words back to me. “We’re going\\nfishing.”\\n“’Cause I got dirtier than you did this morning,” I laugh out, taunting\\nher.\\nShe shoots me a dirty look, telling me she knows exactly how I got\\ndirty, but neither one of us gives up. I yank one of her braids,  she elbows\\nme, and I laugh, seeing a little smile peek out from her , too, as we battle.\\nI finally get the door open only for her to shove herself in front of me to\\ntry to get into the bathroom first. I step on her foot and she stumbles, but I\\nwrap my arm around her waist and pull her back as she grabs  hold of the\\ndoorframe, not giving up the ship.\\nLaughter rolls through me, the sudden ur ge to take her to the ground and\\ntickle the shit out of her clawin g at me. I can’t wait to get her to the lake. I’m not sure I’ve ever played with a woman I wasn’ t worried about\\nscrewing.\\nI pull her off the doorframe, and she screams, but it evolves into a laugh\\nas her legs—bare in jean shorts—kick at me, and her stinky Vans hit the\\nwall.\\n“Shit, you stink,” I say . “Did you roll around in shit or something?”\\n“I stepped in it!” she growls.\\nI chuckl e. It’s like having a little sister . Maybe the day won’ t wind up so\\nbadly , after all.\\nBut just as I finish the thought, another voice pierces the silence.\\n“Noah?” someone says.\\nMy stom ach sinks, and I halt, my smile slowly falling. Tiernan and I fall\\nsilent, and I release her, both of us standing upright as we turn our heads\\ntoward my bedroom door .\\nRemi stands there in the doorway , watching us.\\nAnd she clearly didn’ t take the hint to leave as she’s only dressed in one\\nof my T -shirts instead of her own clothes.\\nShe crooks her finger at me, and I’d rather cut of f my left ball.\\nI push Tiernan into the bathroom, following her, and slam the door shut,\\nlocking us in. I push her down on the toilet.\\n“What the hell are you doing?” She glares up at me.\\n“Just sit down,” I order her, reaching behind the shower curtain and\\nturning on the water . “Just… sit down until she leaves, okay?”\\n“Why?”\\nBecause I need a cock blocker . Why do you think, dumbass? If I shower\\nalone, Remi might try to join me or some shit.\\n“Just do what I say ,” I tell her instead.\\nTiernan’ s eyebrows pinch together in confusion, and I shake my head.\\nRemi’ s sweat feels like it’s sittin g on my lungs with the thousand other\\nmornings of waking up to faces just like hers. I’m nothing, and the longer\\nI’m not drunk, the longer I have to face that fact. I take a swig of the beer .\\nBut as I drink, T iernan bolts of f the toilet seat and leaps for the door .\\nI grab the back of her jeans and haul her back, her body slamming into\\nmine.\\n“Noah!” she scolds.\\nBut I wrap my arms around her anyway , pulling her away from the door .\\n“Don’ t leave me. She wants my body again.” “Ugh.”\\nI hold her , taking another big swallow .\\nBut then a knock hits the hardwood, and we still.\\nNooooo…\\n“Noah?” I hear Remi call. “Are you coming to the bar tonight?” the girl\\nasks through the door .\\n“Yes!” T iernan shouts. “He’ s com—”\\nI clamp my free hand over her mouth.\\nAnd then another bellow sounds from downstairs. “Noah!”\\nI flinch.  What the fuck? Is everyone obsessed with me today? Thank\\nGod Kaleb can’ t talk, too.\\nTiernan thrashes in my arms, and I don’t know why, but I squeeze her\\ntighter as I back away from the locked door , closing my eyes.\\n“Noah!” he shouts again.\\n“I’m in the shower!” I finally belt out at my father downstairs.\\nJesus.\\nBut just then, Tiernan slams her heel into my leg, and I stumble\\nbackward, falling with her in my arms.\\nThe backs of my knees hit the bathtub, I lose my footing, and we both\\nfall back into the tub, Tiernan still in my arms as she crashes  against my\\nchest.\\nShe yelps, tearing the shower curtain off a couple rings as my spine hits\\nthe porcelain and her head bangs back into my chin.\\nI grunt.\\n“Oh, my God,” she cries, spitting water as the shower drenches her\\nclothes and hair and she tries to sit up. “Y ou’re insane. What the hell?”\\nBut I clamp a hand over her mouth and pull her back. “I need you to\\nstay.”\\nThe water sprays down as steam billows in the air, and I train my ears,\\nlistening for the people I’m hiding from as my stomach knots because I’m\\nobviously a fucking girl.\\n“Noah!” Dad bellows again.\\nI drop my head back, letting out a sigh. “Why won’ t he just fucking shut\\nup?”\\nI take my hand away from her mouth, but when she tries to bolt, I grab\\nthe back of her collar and pull her back to me again.\\n“They’ll go away if we’re really quiet,” I tell her . “Have you seen your father?” she spits back. “He’ s bigger than the door ,\\nNoah. All he has to do is push really hard with his hand, and if he breaks in\\nhere, he’ll make me do more chores, and I already did my morning stuf f!”\\n“Shhh!” I cover her mouth with my hand again. “They’ll shut up if\\nwe’re really , really quiet.”\\nShe mumbles behind my hand , something sounding like, “You’re an\\nidiot.”\\nI smile. It kind of feels like being a kid, hiding from our parents. Like\\nhide and seek. I never had much of that. Kaleb stopped talking when I was\\nthree—too young to remember , so I can’ t ever recall him as playful.\\nThere were a few times with my father , though. Some good memories\\nbefore he got older and angrier .\\nI look down at T iernan.\\nI was angry with her yesterday .\\nBut then I wasn’ t.\\nThey don’ t talk to me. No one talks to me.\\nI wanted to wring her neck one minute, but then the next, I wanted to\\nhold her .\\nI got it. I knew what was wrong.\\nShe sucks in quick, sudden breaths, and I pinch her nose before she can\\nsneeze.\\nIt cuts loose anyway as she spits on my hand, and I snort at the little\\nwhimper she lets out. I rinse off my hand and wrap my arm around her\\nagain.\\n“What was it like in L.A.?” I ask her. “Tell me something about your\\nlife.”\\nAnything. I want to go somewhere, even if we can’ t leave the tub.\\nBut she remains silent.\\nI lean my head back again, staring up at the ceiling.\\n“You ever feel like you’re in a box?” I mumble. “And all you see are\\nyour four walls no matter what  you do? No matter how far you walk, the\\nview never changes?”\\n“You can’t ask me what to do to be happy ,” she says. “I came to\\nColorado.”\\nYeah, that won’ t work for me.\\nBut for her…? “Did it work?” I ask, tugging her braid gently when she stays quiet.\\n“Cuz?”\\nShe jerks her head away , throwi ng me a scowl, but I see the smile peek\\nout. “I like my view a little better , yeah.”\\nBut then she does a double-take. “Y our nose is bleeding.”\\nI wipe it, pulling my hand back and seeing blood on my fingers . I rinse\\nit off with water a few times, clearing the blood away .\\n“You don’t need  to be so violent,” I say as I jab her in the side for head-\\nbutting me.\\nShe squirms. “No, stop,” she argues as I jab some more. “I’m not a fan\\nof tickling.”\\nI laugh and continue to dig my fingers into her sides. She squeal s, trying\\nto get away , but there’ s nowhere to go.\\n“Noah?” A pound lands on the door . “You comin’ out? I have to leave.”\\nTiernan looks at me, and I jab her once more.\\n“Noah’ s not here,” I tell her what to say .\\nShe slaps my hand away . “No.”\\n“Say it.”\\n“No!” she whisper -yells.\\nI jab her again, and she recoils. “Say it.”\\n“It’s mean,” she replies through tight lips. “No!”\\nI grab her arm. “I’ll snake bite you.”\\nShe slaps me as another knock lands on the door .\\nI go for it. Fistin g her forearm with both hands, I see her eyes go wide\\nwith fear , and I twist, watching her go kicking and screaming.\\n“Ow!”\\nWe tussle, water flying everywhere, and she kicks and hits, her elbow\\nalmost landing right in my crotch.\\n“Stop it,” she sputters, but she breaks out in uncontrollable giggles, and\\nI release her finally .\\n“You’re laughing,” I tell her .\\n“I’m not.” She sits up, righting herself.\\nMy breathing calms, and my heartbeat slows again as she push es stray\\nhair out of her face but makes no move to leave the shower yet.\\nI lean back, both arms resting on the sides of the tub and her leaning\\nagainst the wall, her legs up and her V ans hanging over the side of the tub.\\n“Why don’ t you want to smile?” I ask her . She doesn’ t ask for anything—doesn’ t seem to want anything. She acted\\nlike it didn’ t hurt her yesterday when Kaleb excluded her .\\nI reach out, grazing my thumb over the skin between her eyebrows.\\n“The wrinkles are always up here,” I tell her and then move my hand down\\nto the corner of her mouth where her laugh lines should be. “But not here.”\\nShe looks over at me. The water spills around us, and I spot drops\\nstreaming down  her face and catching between her lips. Lips that are full\\nand pink and look like gum, soft and chewable.\\nOn reflex, I clench my teeth.\\n“Noah!” My father pounds on the door .\\nBut I barely blink, unable to stop looking at her. Her wet legs, the water\\ngliding down the sliver of chest visible, because of the lost button on my\\nshirt…\\nTiernan holds my eyes. “Noah’ s not in here,” she calls out.\\nAnd I grin. Reaching out, I tickle her neck, and she tries to bite me\\nbefore I pull away , laughing under my breath.\\nMy father ’s footsteps fall away , and I’m not sure if he believes Tiernan\\nor not, but at least he’ s backing of f.\\nHopefully , Remi is on her way, too. I used to feel bad about trying to get\\ngirls out of my house after we were done, but I can’t muster the effort to\\ncare.\\nIt’s not Remi’ s fault, though. I know that. She’s just a reminder of how\\ncheaply my time is spent.\\nTiernan digs behind her and brings up my beer bottle, which I lost at\\nsome point.\\nShe raises her eyebrows at me.\\n“We’re going fishing,” I tell her . “It’s day-drinking day .”\\nAnd I snatch it out of her hand , feeling that it’s still half-full before I\\ntake a swig.\\nShe shakes her head, but I spot the smile in her eyes.\\nWe’re quiet for a few seconds, and I kind of feel like she doesn’ t want\\nto go out there, either .\\n“I love the beach,” she finally murmurs.\\nI shoot my eyes up to her .\\n“In L.A,” she clarifies, not looking at me. “It was my only favorite\\nthing, I think.”\\nOh, right. I asked her about her life in California. She glances at me, a smile peeking out. “I can see you there,” she\\nmuses.\\nDamn right, you can. I fit in everywhere.\\nShe pauses as she stares off. “When I was fourteen, I was obsessed with\\noldies music. I don’ t know why .”\\nI listen, liking having someone to talk to in the house.\\nShe continues, “I found out that Surf City, U.S.A. was actually\\nHuntington Beac h, California. So one rainy morning, I took my father ’s ’47\\nFord Woody,” she laughed a little, “—the only thing he owned that I loved\\n—and I drove to Surf City . My parents were still in bed, and I was on spring\\nbreak from school. I had never taken one of his cars. I didn’ t even have a\\nlicense yet. I just grabbed a backpack stuf fed with books and… drove.”\\nShe drops her eyes, something I can’t read creasing her brow . I narrow\\nmy gaze as I watch her absently fiddle with the hem of my shirt that she\\nwears.\\nSomething happened that day .\\nWhen she speaks again, her voice is almost a whisper . “It was still early\\nwhen I got there. I sat down on the beach, watching the morning waves roll\\nin.” A wistful look fills her eyes. “It was so beautiful. People love looking\\nat the ocean at sunrise or sunset, but I love looking at it right before the sun\\nis up or right after sundown.” A glint of excitement lights up her gray eyes\\nas she looks over at me. “Everything is so calm, and the water has this blue-\\ngray hue, like storm clouds. An ocean of storm clouds,” she muses. “The\\nsounds of the waves are like a metronome through your body . The rain\\ntapping your shoulders. The infinite horizon and the dream of just going\\nand losing yourself somewhere out there. No one’ s there. It’ s peaceful.”\\nA solemn look comes over her, and I hold my beer in both hands,\\nwatching her .\\n“After a while,” she continue s, “I finally stood up, lifted up my\\nbackpack, and strapped it on. It was so heavy with books, my knees almost\\nbuckled.”\\nShe swallows.\\n“But I stood strong,” she mumbles. “And walked into the water .”\\nI tighten my hand around the bottle. Walked into the…\\n“I walked until the water came up to my waist,” she says quietly , staring\\noff. “And then up to my shoulders.”\\nWith a pack of books on her back, weighing her down. “And when the water hit my mouth, I started swimming,” she tells me.\\n“Struggling as I tore through the water as fast and hard as I could, because I\\nwasn’ t strong, and I knew any second the weight of the pack would take me\\ndown, but I wanted to go farther . I needed it to be deeper .” She hesitates,\\nwhispering her words like she’ s thinking out loud. “So deep I couldn’ t make\\nit back. So I wouldn’ t be able to make  it back. My feet no longer brushed\\nthe ocean floor . I was going. Farther and further .”\\nI know that feeling. The edge we dance when we want to get to the\\npoint of no return, so we have no choice but to keep going, but I always\\nchicken out. I always fear doing things I can’ t undo.\\n“I remem ber that last moment,” she says, droplets glimmering across\\nher now-tanned skin. “When my muscles burned, because I’d used every\\nounce of strength to keep myself and the pack up. The last moment,\\nknowing I was about to go under . The weight pulling me down. ” She shook\\nher head gently . “Let myself go. Let it happen, I told myself. Just do it. Just\\ndo it. Just let me go.”\\nI can see her, some pier close by as she fights to keep her head up and\\nknowing there’ s almost nothing saving her from the fathom below .\\n“I dropped the pack.” She blinks. “I didn’ t even go under .”\\nLogically , I knew that. She’ s still here, isn’ t she?\\nBut still, I’m glad to hear it wasn’ t a hard decision to stay .\\n“Why’d you drop it?” I ask.\\n“I don’ t know . Maybe I wasn’ t serious.”\\nI reach out and graze her jaw with the backs of my fingers. “Or maybe\\nyou knew you had this and you were going to be okay .”\\nEveryone contemplates suicide at some point, even if it’s just for a\\nminute.\\nAnd one thing is usually the root cause. Loneliness.\\nShe should’ve been with us. Why didn’ t my father make contac t? Invite\\nher for the summ ers? Her parents would’ve let her. Probably would’ve been\\nhappy to get rid of her .\\nAnd I would’ve been happy with someone to talk to, too. Less lonely\\nmyself.\\n“Did they ever realize you snuck out?” I ask.\\nShe nods. “About a month later. When they got the bill for all the\\noverdue library books I dumped at the bottom of the ocean.” A laugh bursts out of me, and I tug on her braid again, seeing her smile,\\ntoo. First lesson in stealing Dad’ s car, sweetheart—cover your tracks.\\nI take another swig and pass the beer to her. “Do you ever go back to\\nthat beach?”\\n“Every time it rains,” she replie s, turning to look at me. “Except now I\\njust bring one book and my earbuds.”\\nShe takes a big drink and passes the bottle back.\\nI like this. I can’ t remember the last time this house felt this good.\\n“You’ve got this,” I hear her say .\\nI look up to see her watching me.\\n“And you’re going to be okay ,” she finishes.\\nShe repeated my words back to me.\\nAnd better yet…I didn’ t have to tell her. If only my father could see\\nanything beyond the end of his nose.\\n“Rinse of f,” she says, standing up. “And hurry up about it.”\\nI down the rest of the beer, leaving it on the soap dish, and rise up,\\nswitching places  with her. Our chests brush as she squeezes past, and I tip\\nmy head  back, letting the water run over my scalp. She immed iately turns\\ntoward the back of the tub to give me privacy .\\n“You might want to get out.” I tug her braid twice. “So I can get naked.”\\n“I’m dripping wet.”\\nSuit yourself.\\nI peel off my jeans and wring them out, tossing them out of the shower\\nand seeing her eyes follow . Her back straightens as she locks her hands\\nbehind her back in some forced calm.\\nI wash and rub the muscles in my neck, but I can’t take my eyes off her\\nback the whole time.\\nShe needs a lot, and all of them are things you can’t buy. She needs to\\nlaugh and get drunk. She needs to be tickled and cuddled and carried and\\nteased. I don’t want to see her cry, but if she does, I want her to know\\nthere’ s comfort.\\nShe has a home.\\nI shove the showerhead toward the wall, so I’m clear of the water , and\\ngrab a towel of f the rack, wrapping it around my waist.\\nApproaching, I stand just behind her, enjoying her nervousness. She’s\\nbarely breathing. And then a thought of what else a young woman might need occurs to\\nme, and my smile falls.\\nHow does she feel when she gets carried away?\\nI take her braid , rubbing the hair between my fingers as I lick my\\nsuddenly dry lips.\\nShe looks up at me, her eyes big for once, and I blink, snapping myself\\nout of it.\\nI gently pull on her braid again. “Blueberry pancakes?” I ask.\\nI bat my eyelashes, giving her my best pouty face.\\n“With extra blueberries?” I beg.\\nShe purses her lips and crosses her arms, looking away again.\\nBut she doesn’ t say no.\\n“Thanks.” And then I plant a kiss on her forehead and yank down hard\\non her braid again, chuckling and jumping out of the tub as she slaps my\\nback in my escape.\\nI pull the shower curtain closed for her and take another towel off the\\nrack, drying my hair .\\nTurning around, I reach for the door and unlock the knob, but then I see\\nsomething come out of the shower out of the corner of my eye and stop.\\nTiernan’ s flannel—my flannel—lays on the floor outside the tub,\\ndiscarded.\\nI dart my eyes up, squeezing the door handle as the shape of her through\\nthe white shower curtain moves. Jean shorts fall next, and I look away , still\\ngripping the handle.\\nMy body warms.\\nI can already hear it. The winte r winds that will blow through the attic\\nin a couple short months. The smell of the snow that will come this winter .\\nMonths of a quiet house and darkness and rooms with her in them.\\nMoments, showers, corners, silent nights…\\nAnd for once, I might be excited to be here for it.\\nWithout thinking, I twist the lock again and look over at her through the\\ncurtain.\\nI can almost see her underwear sticking to her body . Remem ber the\\ntoned calves and thighs.\\nWhat if she likes me? What if it’s just once? A secret? Someth ing my\\nfather never has to know? Maybe not today but maybe tomorrow . Or next week. In here, in the\\nshower , where no one has to see.\\nBut I shake my head and unlock the door , leaving quickly .\\nJesus Christ. That’ s not what she needs.\\nAnd another notch on my belt is not what I need.\\nI need my head examined. The poor kid just lost her parents.\\n \\n \\n“Oh, wow,” Tiernan says, jumping down from the truck and looking over at\\nthe waterfall.\\nIt took two hours to get chores done, get the truck packed up with beers,\\nsnacks, and fishing gear , and drive up here.\\nI slam the door as Kaleb starts  walking toward the water . “Yeah…” I\\nlook across the small pond to the waterfall pouring over the cliff, hitting the\\nsurface, and the calm water flowing out of the alcove to a stream to the left.\\n“I can see why you never left,” she says, smiling over at my dad.\\nHe smiles at her , pulling of f his shirt.\\nI glance at Tiernan, seeing a blush cross her cheeks as she averts her\\neyes back to the fall.\\nI grit my teeth together . “Right? ” I reply sarcastically . “Because the rest\\nof the world has nothing else to of fer.”\\nI throw my dad a look and see his eyes narrow on me.\\n“Get the cooler ,” he orders.\\nI smirk to myse lf as I do what I’m told. Pulling the cooler out of the\\nbed, I walk it over to the beach, Tiernan following me. I’m aggravated she\\nwent to the other pond alone, but I’m glad we brought her to this one for her\\nfirst time. This one is more fun.\\n“Does no one else come here?” she asks.\\nI set the cooler down, seeing her look around the small, empty beach.\\n“They do,” I tell her. “But it’s still early . In the winter , thoug h, we’ll\\nhave it to ourselves.”\\nI pull of f my shirt and kick of f my shoes.\\n“A frozen lake,” she muses. “T o ourselves. Fantastic.”\\nCliffs rise in front of us, the water spilling down as trees and foliage\\nsurround us, shielding us from heavy sunlight, but to the left, the trees clear\\na little for the river as it babb les over rocks. Granite and moss fill my nostrils, and I might enjoy the sight if I hadn’ t already been here a thousand\\ntimes.\\nI look over at Tiernan, liking that view better . She wears a pair of white\\nshorts and one of her own plaid shirts, but it’s pink and blue and fitted like\\nthe expensive ones are. I take in her outfit. Is she swimming in that or…?\\n“You okay?” I ask her , noticing she’ s staring of f.\\nBut when I follow her gaze, I see she’s watching Kaleb. He climbs the\\ncliff next to the fall, wearing only jeans.\\n“Yeah.”\\n“We’re gonna dive,” I tell her . “Wanna come?”\\n“Dive?” She pulls her shades down over her eyes. “Won’t you scare the\\nfish?”\\nI chuckle. “Excuses, excuses.”\\nAnd I walk into the water , diving in after a few feet. The fall splashes,\\nchurning up the cool water , and I can’t keep the grin off my face as I catch\\nup with my brother .\\n“She’ s definitely  a reason to stay, isn’t she?” I call up to him, a few feet\\nabove me. “I like having her around.”\\nKaleb keeps going, crawling the incline to the top of the waterfall.\\n“Nod once if you’re thinking the things I’m thinking,” I say .\\nFinally , he glances down at me, his dark eyes dead as usual as he pauses\\nhis climb.\\nBut I keep going . “I know you are,” I tease. “You were going at her so\\nhard the other night, she couldn’ t get a word out.”\\nHis gaze looks out, back over to the beach where Tiernan is. I look, too,\\nseeing she’s taken off her shirt, sporting a white bikini top on a body she\\nhides damn well under my clothes. Her breasts are almost too big for the\\ntop, but she keeps her shorts on as she sits on her blanket, arms resting on\\nher knees and looks up at us through her sunglasses.\\n“What did she feel like?” I ask.\\nBut when I turn around, Kaleb is climbing again, sweat making his\\nblack hair stick to his neck and temples.\\n“Kaleb?” I grab a pebble and throw it at his legs. “What was it like?”\\nHe scowls down at me but keeps going.\\nI glance back at her again. My dad squats down next to her, showing her\\nhow to bait a hook. I have to give her credit. She is indulging him. I fucking\\nhate fishing. “I wond er what she feels like when she’s happy ,” I tell him. “When she\\ngives herself to someone and lets herself want it.”\\nI’d love to see what she looks like when she’ s alive.\\n“I hated that yesterday , you know ? Seeing her like that.” I don’t know if\\nhe’s even listening, but I keep watching her . “She needs us.”\\nI need another presence in the house if I’m going to make it through\\nanother winter here.\\nI turn back to Kaleb, and he’ s stopped. He looks down at me.\\n“Don’ t run her off,” I warn him. “I mean it. If she stays, I’ll stay.” And\\nthen I add, “For the winter , anyway .”  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\n“You said you didn’ t want to fish,” my uncle says behind me.\\nI reel in the line, glancing over my shoulder and seeing him approach.\\nI turn back around.\\nHe found me.\\nMy flannel, tied around my waist, blows against my thighs as the skin\\non my bare back and shoulders prickles.\\nHe stops next to me, baiting his hook.\\nAfter the boys darted off to cliff dive before, Jake tried to get me to fish,\\ndroning on about how the reel and rod work and how to cast a line, but I\\nbarely listened. Kaleb’ s jump off the top of the waterfall made my stomach\\ndrop even more than it already had during my interaction with Noah this\\nmorning.\\nI hadn’ t wanted him to leave the shower .\\nI waited for him to touch me.\\n“You don’ t like help, do you?” Jake asks me.\\nI draw in a breath. Nope.  Which is why I decided to sneak over here\\nwhen you weren’ t looking and do it myself.\\nI watch the wate r flow where my line disappears under the surface. Do\\nfish actually swim in streams with this much of a current?\\n“You’re not asking, you know?”  he continues, trying to catch my eyes.\\n“I was of fering.”\\n“I’m a loner .” He snorts under his breath. The current pulls the line, and I reel it in a\\nfew inches as he casts his own, the spool singing loudly .\\nHe clears his throat. “So how is it you can shoot, but not fish?”\\n“I never cared to learn.”\\n“And now?”\\nI throw him a look. “I don’t want to be the only one who doesn ’t know\\nhow.”\\nI don’t want the boys doing everything for me. And learning new things\\nkeeps my mind busy. I can do origami, play three songs on the ukulele, type\\nseventy words a minute, and it only took me three months to train myself to\\ndo a handstand.\\n“Competitive, huh?” he asks.\\n“No, why?” I arch an eyebrow . “Is that a de Haas family trait?”\\n“No, a V an der Ber g one.”\\nI look up at him. I expected a remark about my family .\\n“You’re ours now ,” he says and looks down to meet my eyes.\\nOurs now .\\nWhen you’r e her e, you’r e a V an der Ber g, Noah had said.\\nJake’ s soft eyes hold mine, and the way he stares at me makes warmth\\nbubble up in my chest, and I don’t know why. Noah and Kaleb seem miles\\naway .\\nI look away, suddenly aware he’s half-dressed, but his eyes stay on me.\\nI can see him out of the corner of my eye as I reel my line back in a little.\\nHis smell surrounds me—a mixture of grass, coffee, and something else I\\ncan’t place.\\n“These things are like ropes,” he says, and I feel him pick up one of my\\nbraids.\\nHe squeezes my thick, blonde braid in his fist and releases it, clearing\\nhis throat. “Can I tell you something?” he asks.\\nI glance at him, my heart beating fast.\\n“Fish are usually hanging out where there’ s a change in current or a\\nchange in depth ,” he tells me. “See that eddy over there? The still water by\\nthe rock?”\\nI follow  where he’s pointing, looking past the small rapid and\\nwhitewater , to the small, gently swirling pool.\\nI nod. “That’ s where we want to get your line,” he explains. “They’ll be\\nwaiting for insects, minnows, and all the other little guys to get washed\\ndown in the rapid.”\\nOh.\\nThat makes sense. I thought fish just swam everywhere.\\nSetting down his pole, he takes mine, reels it in, and then takes my\\nhand, leading me out into the stream.\\nI tighten my grip, feeling the grooves of his rough palm in mine, almost\\nwanting to thread my fingers through his just to feel it more.\\nMy feet hit the cold water , my shoes instantly filling up as we tread out\\na few feet, and he comes up behind me, fitting my hand in his and putting\\nboth of ours on the handle.\\nI still, his bare chest blanketing my naked back, and I close my eyes for\\na moment.\\nPulling our arms back, in uniso n, he tosses the line, letting it fly to the\\nstill pool and reeling it back in.\\n“If you don’t like fishing,” he says behind me, his voice low and husky ,\\n“there’ s a pretty cool cave behin d the waterfall. It doesn’ t go that deep, but\\nit’s peaceful.”\\nWe cast the line again, trying to reach just beyond the pool. “Sounds\\nlike a good place for teenagers to do bad things,” I joke.\\n“As a matter of fact…” He chuckles.\\nOh, great. I can only imagine what the boys get up to back there,\\ngrowing up here as they have.\\n“If a guy takes you there,” he tells me, “now you’ll know what he’s\\nafter.”\\n“Then maybe you should take me.”\\nHe stops spinning the reel, and I stop breathing. That sounded…\\nOh, my God.\\n“I’ll be safer with you,” I rush to add, turning my head to glance at him.\\n“I mean, right?”\\nHe stares down at me, almost like he’s not breathing, either . “Yeah,” he\\nmutters.\\nHe finishes reeling the line back  in, and I take it from him. Rearing my\\narm back slowly to give him time to veer out of my way, I cast the line,\\npressing my thumb into the button as soon as my arm shoots out in front of me. The line—silver in the sunlight—glints as it flies, and I land it just at\\nthe far edge of the pool.\\n“Good,” he says. “One more time.”\\nHis heat covers my back, makin g the rest of my body miss the warmth.\\nI reel the line back in.\\nHolding the handle, I inhale through my nose and finally pinpoint the\\npart of his scent I couldn’ t place before. Burnt wood. He smells like a fall\\nnight.\\nUnable to stop myself, I lean back a little, meeting his chest with my\\nback as he puts his hand over mine on the handle.\\n“Am I crowding you?”\\n“No.” I shake my head.\\nHere I am, saying I don’ t need help, but please don’ t take your hand off.\\nHe fits his grip on top of mine, both of us holding the handle and my\\narm resting on top of his.\\nHe draw s my arm backward. “Back,” he whispers with my thumb on\\nthe button and his thumb on me. And then we throw it, flickin g our wrists\\nas he calls out, “Release,” casting the line far out into the stream.\\nIt billow s into the air, pulled by the weight of the bait and drops  into the\\nwater with a plunk.\\nHis chest move s rapidly behind me, and I can barely hear his voice\\nwhen he says, “That’ s good, T iernan.”\\nBut he doesn’ t move.\\nA light sweat covers my forehead, my breasts heave, and I wonder if his\\neyes are on them. I hope—\\n“We haven’t had a woman living in the house since their mother ,” he\\ntells me. “I don’ t have a… a great track record with taking care of women.”\\nI look over my shoulder and up at him.\\nHe shakes his head, whispering, “No matter how hard I try .”\\nHis brow  is etched with pain as he focuses on the stream, and my throat\\ntightens.\\nHis first love killed herself, and the mother of his children was sent to\\nprison. He feels responsible.\\n“I thought I was protecting Kaleb and Noah, keeping them secluded up\\nhere,” he says, watching his line. “I think I just gave up, though. I didn’ t\\nwant to fail again.” I gaze at his eyes and how youn g they still are. How they betray all the\\nthings he still wants.\\n“I didn’ t even have a desire to try ,” he murmurs.\\nThen he looks down at me, and everything else stops.\\n“But now we have you,” he tells me.\\nHis heated stare holds me frozen, and something pulls at every inch of\\nmy skin, begging for something.\\nHis hands. His rough hands.\\nHeat pools low in my belly , and I’m wet. I feel the slickness between\\nmy thighs as I throb, embarrassment rising to my cheeks.\\nThe fishing pole slips through my fingers, I jump, sucking in a breath,\\nand watch the stream carry it away , bobbing over the current.\\n“I’m sorry ,” I rush out. My mouth hangs open, and I back away , looking\\nat Jake. “I’m...”\\nI struggle to keep my balance on the wet rocks.\\nHe shakes his head, his voice gentle. “It’s okay ,” he says, watch ing me.\\n“Tiernan…”\\n“I’m really sorry ,” I say again and dash away , jogging back up onto the\\nbeach and heading for the pond.\\nI need to dive. I need my whole body under the cold water .\\nOh, my God. What was that? Did he know what I was thinking? Could\\nhe tell? He’ s spilling his guts, and I’m standing there, getting turned on?\\nI charge for the pond, the boys nowhere in sight. Dropping my shorts\\nand peeling of f my shoes, I wade into the water a few feet and dive, the cool\\nfreshwater cove ring my body and caressing my scalp. My pores open up,\\nreleasing more heat, and I continue swimming, not wanting to come up and\\nshow my shame.\\nOnly when my lungs are painfully stretched do I pop up to the surface,\\ndrawing in deep breaths. The waterfall pounds, shielding all other noise and\\nenveloping me in a sort of silence as the mist hits my face.\\nJake must think I’m such a girl. Emotional. Erratic.\\nI close my eyes and sink under the water again. Jesus.\\nI swim around the waterfall, grabbing hold of the rock as the water\\npummels my back. The sun is gone, and I push up, gasping for air and\\nslicking my hair back over my head.\\nI look around, the water pounding behind me and shielding me from\\neverything. I spot the entrance to the cave Jake mentioned, and trail down the rock ledge, heading for it, because it’s a decent place to hide for the\\nmoment.\\nMy feet touch sharp rocks underneath the water , patches of icy water\\nhitting my skin as I lightly step up for support. Water flows into the cave,\\nledges on both sides, and the hair on my neck rises as I look around the\\nblack den. I can hop up on the pathways on the side of the tunnel and walk\\ndeeper inside. Who knows how many caves and rooms sit of f to the sides?\\nTipping my head back, I feel drips hit my face as the roof bleeds, and I\\ninhale the musty scent of wet rock and dark earth that sinks into my lungs.\\nA giant red octopus is spray-painted on the wall to my right, chipped\\nand worn after years of erosion. W as it here when my uncle last was?\\nDo the boys come here?\\nMy stomach swirls as I close my eyes, letting my heart calm and my\\nhead wander .\\nI shouldn’ t have been having those thoughts about Noah in the shower . I\\nshould’ve stopped Kaleb the moment he started.\\nI shouldn’ t feel…nervous aroun d Jake Van der Berg. I’m desperate for\\nattention and confused.\\nIt feels good.\\nAnd right now, I want it. Drifting away behind my closed lids, I dive\\ndeep into my head, in the dark cave and surrounded by the thund er of water ,\\nso no one can hear my thoughts except me.\\nHere, I’m safe.\\nHe’s there. Close. T aking my hand.\\nI follow  as he leads me deeper into the cavern, and I want to go with\\nhim. I want him to want me somewhere dark and private.\\nI stop, and he circles around me, coming up behind me and pulling the\\nstrings of my top. My bikini falls away , and my instinct is to cover myself,\\nbut he reaches around and scoops up my breasts in both hands before I have\\na chance.\\nI groan at the images in my head, grabbing onto the rock for support.\\nThe tiny pulse between my legs throbs, and I slide my hand under the water\\nand inside my bottoms.\\nI breathe hard. Shit. God, I want…\\nI want…\\nHe squeezes me, pulling me hard against his wet chest, and he doesn’ t\\ntalk. This is a secret. My nipples pebble, the hard, little points poking through my swimsuit\\ntop, and I rub my middle finger over my clit in small, slow circles. Gripping\\nthe rock by my head, I imagine him at my back, and I shake my head, trying\\nto picture anyone else.\\nIt could be anyone.\\nBut it’s the same hard, sun-kissed body pressing into me, his rough\\nfingers against my soft flesh, and I’m so wet and hot, and so…\\nEmpty .\\nI rub faster , gasping and whimpering, all alone in the cave, but I need\\nsomething more. Something I can’ t give myself.\\nSomething solid  inside me and my mouth on him and his eyes looking\\ndown at a body he wants to touch but can’t and taking me in his possessive\\nhands with his lustful eyes and making my heart pound in my chest.\\nHe hates my father but wants me.\\nMy clit pulses as I feel the orgasm crest, and I want him to make me\\nscream and come and feel everything I’m tired of not feeling. I want to be\\nbreathless.\\nFuck me.\\nFuck me.\\n“No!” someone suddenly shouts. “Stop!”\\nI pop my eyes open, pulling my hand out of my bottoms. The pulse\\nbetween my thighs rages as the or gasm aches and fades away .\\n“No, I said…” But her voice lowers to a mumble, and I dart my eyes\\naround, looking for anyone.\\nWho is that?\\nGod, if anyone saw…\\nI twist my neck, taking in the empty cavern and no other bodies in the\\npool or by the waterfall.\\n“Ugh!” a woman cries out, and I hear a shuf fle as I back away .\\nNo one else was on the beach when we came, and I didn’ t notice anyone\\nelse show up. Who…?\\nBut just as I push myself back in the water , getting ready to bolt, a\\nfigure emer ges from the darkness, and I freeze as a young woman steps out\\nof some tunnel or adjoining cave.\\nShe sees me and stops.\\nCici Diggins. The woman from the pharmacy who was a little too\\ninterested in who I was. She must’ve arrived while I was fishing . She wears a blue bikini, her long, dark hair wet and spilling around her, and I spot a\\ntrickle of blood coming out of one of her nostrils.\\nI narrow my eyes. Why is she bleed—\\nShe walks past me, above on the ledge, and dives back into the water ,\\ndisappearing beyond the waterfall.\\nWhat the hell? Who hit her?\\nJust then, I hear pebbles shuffle, and I turn back around in time to see\\nKaleb walk out of the same tunnel she just came from.\\nThe water shim mers across his dark eyes as they meet mine, and he\\nsteps forward, dropping into the water and sinking waist deep, dressed only\\nin his jeans.\\nHe stalks toward me, and I back up toward the waterfall, unblinking.\\nDid he hit her? I scan his face and body , seeing no marks of self-\\ndefense.\\nThe room is dark, and it’s just us, his hard eyes zoning in on me the\\ncloser he gets, and my heart leaps into my throat.\\nBut then… he just walks right past me. Diving under the wate rfall, he\\ndisappears, too, and the fear of what I’d been doing to myself under the\\nwater with them right in here is thankfully overshadowed by what the hell\\nwas just going on in that tunnel.\\nWhat was she ar guing with him about? He didn’ t do that to her , did he?\\nAnd how the hell do you argue with someone who doesn’ t speak? How\\ndoes that work?\\nI head out of the cave, swimming under the water and back out to the\\nmiddle of the pond. My uncle  loads up the truck in the distance, Noah\\nhelping him, and I watch the guys working, my cheeks warming at the\\nmemory of my fantasy . I never actually put a face to him in the dream, but I\\nknow who it was.\\nIt’s okay .\\nEveryone has thoughts. Every one touches themselves. A therapist\\nwould say I’m seeking an outlet to cope with my troubles. That’ s what this\\nis, and better this than drugs or alcohol.\\nThe breeze causes the water to ripple, and I dip my lips in, wetting them\\nas I watch the guys load the truck.\\nIt did feel good,  though. The feel of him at my back, his smell around\\nme, the thought of his bed covered in that scent…\\n“Tiernan, come on!” Noah yells over at me. I blink, looking up at him. He climbs on his bike.\\n“They’re having a pop-up race in Gent,” he calls out. “Let’ s go!”\\nA pop-up race?\\nKaleb throws his leg over the other bike, while Jake climbs into the\\ntruck, and I quickly nod, swimming for shore.\\nNot sure what a pop-up race is, but it sounds noisy . And crowded.\\nTwo things I typically hate, but maybe Jake isn’t right this time. Maybe\\na nice, non-familial distraction away from the peak is exactly what I need,\\nafter all.\\nPretty sure the three best-lookin g guys in town live under my roof, but\\nwe’re going to Gent, is it? Whole new babe pool, as Noah would say .\\n \\n \\n“What’ s a pop-up race?”\\nJake glances over at me as he pulls through the crowd and veers toward\\na clearing on the left.\\nGreen hills rise up on both sides in front of me as the sun slowly slips\\nbehind, and the smoke from the bonfire stings my eyes. Firecrackers,\\nremnants from the 4th of July probably , pop in the distance, and I inhale the\\nscent of barbecue.\\n“A good opportunity to network ,” he replies. “It’s almost the off season.\\nIt’s just a bunch of racers, vendo rs, and sponsors getting in some last, good\\npractice and making some money .”\\nThe truck bobs over the terrain of grass and dirt, and he finally  hits the\\nbrake, putting the truck in Park.\\n“What will I do here?” I ask him.\\n“Keep your butt under our tent, that’ s what.”\\nHe hops out, and I follow him to the back as he pulls the tailgate down.\\nI frown but help him start to unload. Noah comes speeding up with\\nKaleb behind him, and I look away , taking the other end of the pop-up tent\\nfor Jake.\\nHow did Cici get a bloody nose? I need to talk to Jake about that. I’m\\nliving with Kale b, and Jake doesn’t know how aggressive he got with me\\nthe other night. What if there’ s more he doesn’ t know?\\nI look over my shoulder at Kaleb again, his jeans now mostly dry and a\\nblack T-shirt on. He pulls off his helmet and hangs it on the handlebar , ignoring the people calling to him and walking over to take a beer from the\\ncooler .\\nHe doesn’ t look at me before he turns around and disappears into the\\ncrowd.\\n“Tiernan.”\\nI turn my attention back to my uncle and continue walking.\\nIt only takes the two of us twenty minutes—no choice, because the boys\\nran off—before we have all the swag, gear, posters, and display set up. Jake\\npositions the guys’ motorbikes on either end of the table, and I dig out the\\nBluetooth speaker we had while fishing and sync it to my phone, starting a\\nplaylist.\\nRatt’ s “Nobody Rides for Free” pops on, and he laughs under his breath,\\ntossing me a smile. Fitting, I guess.\\nPushing my rolled sleeves up, I grab some decals off the table and stand\\nin front of the tent, handing them out to passersby . Jake glances at me, and I\\noffer a half-smile as he heads over to talk to a couple looking at one of the\\nbikes.\\nI’m not sure why, but I kind of feel bad that Kaleb and Noah make him\\nfight for every inch of help. I’m not one to take a parent’ s side, but Jake\\ngoing through what he went through to get here and build all this, he\\ndeserves a family .\\nI guess I don’ t like seeing him alone in everything.\\n“I’m gonna go,” Noah says, coming under the tent and grabbing his\\nhelmet.\\nHe wears racing gear, black and orange pants and long-sleeved shirt\\nwith the number seventy-eight on the front and back. Is he racing?\\nSeeing me, he pauses and grins. He sets the helmet back down and\\ncomes behind me, reaches around my waist, pulls up my shirt, and ties the\\ntwo flaps high up. He knots it right under my breasts, my stoma ch bare, and\\nthen he winks at me with his cocky blue eyes. I scowl.\\n“If you bare it, they will come,” he chants. “And by come, I mean—”\\nI swat at him. Gross.\\nHe just laughs, walking away to grab his helmet, and I touch the knot,\\ntrying to loosen it to pull my shirt back down.\\nBut then a guy is suddenly in front of me.\\n“Hey ,” he says, holding out his hand for a complimentary Van der Berg\\ndecal. He smiles, and I twist my lips to the side as I hand him one.\\nOooookay .\\n“Don’ t talk to any sponsors,” I hear my uncle order .\\nI turn to see Noah stuff someth ing into his mouth from the cooler and\\nwalk away .\\n“I might if I win,” he mumbles over his food.\\n“If the bike wins,” Jake retorts, “be sure everyone knows who made it.”\\nA few more people pass by me, pausing to take a decal.\\nNoah charges past, out of the tent, and I hear the announcer come over\\nthe loudspeaker , sounding like the microphone is stuffed halfway down his\\nthroat.\\nEngines rev , and the crowd rushes up the hill for a better view , I assume.\\nI glance  over my shoulder , my uncle seated on a chair with his face buried\\nin the engine—or the carburetor or whatever it is—trying to act like that\\nbolt actually needs to be tightened.\\n“You won’ t watch?” I ask.\\nHe doesn’ t answer , and I clench the decals in both my hands as I stare\\nback out at the crowd. The dirt track runs past here, but the starting line is\\nout of my view . Stars dot the midnight blue sky, and the glow from the\\nstadium lights over the hill pulls at me.\\nIs Kaleb watching him? Seems like someone should be.\\nMy legs itch with the need to set off with everyone else, but I stay\\nplanted.\\nThe track clears, and the announcer starts shouting over the\\nloudspeaker . I know races usual ly start with a gate drop, but I’m not sure if\\nI’m supposed to hear a shot fired or something, too.\\nAfter a moment, though, the crowd up on the hill starts cheering and\\nmoving around, and I know it’s started. The direction of their gaze changes,\\nand I steel my spine and bob a little, desperate to see what’ s happening.\\nI throw a look at my uncle, searching for any reaction, but he’s deep in\\nconcentration as if that rear tire is the most important thing in the world.\\nSomeone should be watching Noah.\\nInching forward, I gauge the crowd on the hill, watching their bodies\\nslowly moving to the left as their eyes follow the racers, and I shoot my\\ngaze in that direction just in time to see a pack of dirt bikes racing around\\nthe bend . Dust kicks up on the track, their whirring getting louder the closer\\nthey get, and I step forward, watching them disappear behind a jump and quickly reappear , flying throug h the air before they disappear back down\\nagain.\\nThe ground vibrates under my feet, the noise of the crowd and the\\nmachines pulsing against my body , and I smile, shooting up on my tiptoes\\nto look for Noah.\\nBikes zoom past, my stomach dropping to my feet as I tip my head\\nback, seeing Noah catch air , his body in his orange and black pants and shirt\\nleaning stick-rod  straight over his handlebars before he comes down again.\\nI laugh, my hand shooting to my head as I watch him race past in his\\nhelmet.\\nI have a sudden urge to cup my hands around my mouth and cheer him\\non.\\nBut I stop midway and clap instead. He looks so good.\\nHe looks incredible. And he’ s in first place.\\nThe same green bike I saw at the Van der Berg house a couple days ago\\ntrails, and I guess that’ s Terrance Holcomb.\\nJerking my smile around, I see my uncle still engrossed in his work.\\nHow can he not watch this?\\nEnvy paralyzes me. Noah looks like he’ s having so much fun.\\nBut I can’t stop myself anymore. Quickly , before Jake has a chance to\\nstop me, I scurry over the dirt track after the bikes have passed and run up\\nthe green hill.\\nI look around, seeing if Kaleb is anywhere close, but I don’ t spot him.\\nJoining the crowd at the top, I squeeze between two people in time to\\nlook down and see Noah speeding for the finish line head to head with\\nHolcomb.\\nHe revs his engine, popping up on the rear wheel, and races over the\\nfinish line, just moments ahead of everyone else as he lands on both wheels\\nagain.\\nThe announcer ’s voice booms, cheers go off, and I see Noah shoot his\\nfist in the air .\\nI clap softly , my heart racing too hard to do more. Good for him.\\nI’m kind of jealo us he’s so good at something like this. I’ve never been\\ngood at anything.\\nSpinning around , I head back to the tent, the spectators dispersing and\\nthe music starting up again. Jake still busies himself working on something I’m sure is fine already ,\\nand I head over to the food stand next to our tent, grabbing some nachos\\nand cheese.\\nTaking a small bite, I approach my uncle. “W ould you like some?”\\nHe meets my eyes but doesn’ t look to see what I have. “No, thank you.”\\nI watch him as I dip another chip in and out of the cheese. “He’s really\\ngood,” I tell him.\\nHe simply nods, going back to his work.\\nI narrow my eyes. Jake isn’ t like my father .\\nBut he is.\\nHannes wouldn ’t have watched me, because he wouldn’ t have cared.\\nJake refuses to support Noah in this. Why?\\nWalking over, I’m about to set my food down and go back to handing\\nout decals, but a crowd heads our way, people swarming Noah. I watch as\\nhe pulls off his shirt and throws it on our table, tossing me a cocky smile as\\nhe grabs my nachos away from  me. He swipes up some cheese, dabs it on\\nmy nose, and then dives in, sucking it of f as I growl.\\n“Noah,” I chide, squirming away , but he just laughs.\\nI was going to congratulate you. Never mind . I wipe the cheese and his\\nspit of f my nose.\\nStealing my chips, he walks over to his father . “You know , I can be a lot\\nmore use to V an der Ber g Extreme if I’m on TV .”\\n“Yeah, and then what?” Jake looks up at his son. “What do you think\\nyou’re going to do after your fifteen minutes are up or an injury sends you\\nhome in a wheelchair?”\\nNoah scoffs, shaking his head. “Were you even watching?” he says. “I\\nwon! I beat them all. I’m good, and I love it.”\\n“Motocross racing—”\\n“Isn’ t a career ,” Noah finished snidely , sounding like he’d had this\\nconversation a hundred times already . “And keeping us chained up on the\\npeak isn’ t a life. Y ou should deal with that.”\\nHe spins around, shoving my nachos back at me, and stalks off again,\\ncircling the waist of some young woman, both of them disappearing into the\\ncrowd.\\nI risk a glance at Jake, seeing his jaw flex as he yanks the socket wrench\\ncounter -clockwise like it’s his kid’s mouth he’s tightening shut instead of a\\nbolt. So that’ s it.\\nIt isn’ t hard to see what Jake loves and values about living his life on his\\nterms, away from the horror of our family .\\nBut Noah’ s hungry for somet hing else. He’s not lazy, careless, or\\nuninspired. He’ s unhappy .\\nSetting down my tray, I walk up and lean on the table where Jake\\nworks.\\n“Is he right?” I ask, hearing the man on the loudspeaker announce\\nanother race. “Are you hiding up here?”\\nHe tosses me a look and then rises to reach around the machine, fiddling\\nwith something.\\n“Pull your shirt down,” he grumbles.\\nI arch an eyebrow , fighting to hold back a smile.\\nHe tosses the tool and leans down on the table, letting out a sigh.\\n“Goddamn kids…” He shakes his head.\\nHe looks over at me, giving me a sad smile. He might not want Noah to\\nbe hurt like he was, but if Jake knows anything, it’s that our parents don’t\\nalways know what’ s best. I mean, who’ s to say Flora would’ve been a\\nhappily-ever -after for him?\\nBut he would’ve  ran with her anyway , because we want what we want.\\nNoah will do the same.\\n“Hey ,” someone says.\\nI turn and see Cici Diggins walking into the tent with her hands in her\\njean pockets as she eyes me.\\nI still. Neither of our interactions have been particularly pleasant. What\\ndoes she want?\\nMy uncle moves away , off to dig in the truck bed for somethin g, and I\\nlook back at Cici, her nose showing no sign that it was bleeding earlier\\ntoday .\\n“Hi,” I finally answer .\\nShe holds her hand out. “Cici.”\\nWe shake. “T iernan.”\\nI guess we haven’ t been properly introduced.\\n“Are you okay?” I gesture to her nose.\\nBut she just breathes out a laugh. “I’m the only one who hurts me.”\\nI release her hand, not sure what that means. I glance  over my shoulder . Jake opens the truck door, digging in the\\nglove box for something.\\n“So, you wanna dance?”\\nI jerk back around, looking at her . What?\\nPeople move around the bonfire, the song drifting out of the big\\nspeakers proppe d up in truck beds around the lot. But the song is slow.\\nThey’re all close.\\nI shake my head. “No.”\\nBut she just grabs my hand anyway and drags me over to the bonfire. I\\nstumble to keep up, trying to pull out of her hand.\\n“Hey , stop,” I bark.\\nI don’ t dance well.\\nTurning around,  she takes my waist and pulls me in, and I shove her off,\\nbut she’s too quick. She grabs the knot my shirt is tied in and jerks me into\\nher, my damn neck nearly getting whiplash.\\nI bare my teeth, feeling my stomach rub against hers where her white\\ntank has ridden up.\\n“It’s okay .” She smirks down at me. “I know you’re straight.”\\nShe moves, swaying her hips and grinding on me a little, and my heart\\nis pound ing out of my damn chest as my feet shift to keep myself from\\nfalling.\\n“Yeah, how do you know?”\\n“You’re saying there’ s a chance you’re not?” she asks, teasing me.\\nI roll my eyes.\\n“You shouldn’ t be,” she says. “I’m a lot safer than a guy. At least, I\\ncan’t get you pregnant.”\\nI can’ t help it. A laugh escapes, and I relax a little.\\nBut not too much.\\n“Why don’ t you cut the act?” I tell her . “You’re doing this to get Kaleb’ s\\nattention.”\\nA little girl-on-girl action, which he’ll certainly notice, because she’s\\ntrying it with someone who lives in his house.\\nI take a glance around. He’s probably not even here anyway . I haven’ t\\nseen him since he parked his bike. Probably hitched a ride home with\\nsomeone else.\\nShe drops her hands to my waist  and comes in, her nose nearly brushing\\nmine. I don’ t know why , but I stand my ground, unflinching.\\n“It takes a lot more than this to get his attention,” she threatens in a low\\nvoice. “Are you available later?”\\nI look away , knowing exactly what she’ s hinting at.\\nI shake my head clear . I’m not letting Kaleb pop my cherry in a\\nthreesome. I’m not letting Kaleb do anything ever again, in fact.\\n“You heard the fight in the cave,” she whispers in my ear. “You were\\neavesdropping.”\\nWas I?\\n“You followed us,” she taunts, “because you want him, too. You were\\njealous.”\\nI quirk a smile, swaying to the music as I slide my arms up and around\\nher neck.\\nEnough.\\nI lean into her ear. “I didn’ t even  know you were back there,” I whisper .\\n“I was hiding, because I was touching myself in the water .”\\nShe bursts out in a snort, bringing her head up and looking at me,\\nincredulous.\\nMy face flushes, and I’m not sure why I just told her that, but I don’t\\nreally care, either . I don’ t like games, and I certainly won’ t play hers.\\n“Seriously?” she asks, almost with an impressed look on her face.\\n“Aren’ t you kind of famous? I could go on Twitter and tell everyone what\\nyou’re telling me now .”\\nYou could anyway . Whether it’ s true or not.\\nStunts like that won’ t get her what she wants anyway . I’m not in her\\nway.\\n“People do what they want.” I squeeze her hips, dancing. “So I don’t\\ncare. About anything. Y our behavior is none of my business.”\\nThen, I flash my gaze over her shoulder and see him.\\nKaleb.\\nHe stands in the distance, beyond the crowd—alone—and leaning\\nagainst a tree trunk. He stares at me as he raises a bottle of beer to his lips\\nand takes a drink, and I swallow the lump in my throat.\\nAnd despite the knot coiling in my stomach every time he looks at me,\\nmy heart pumps hot blood throu gh my body , filling me with the promise of\\nanticipation.\\nThe promise of something about to happen. I can’t stop myself. “And in a few weeks,” I tell her, “I won’ t even\\nknow what’ s happening online anyway , because I’ll be locked away on the\\npeak for months  and months...” I pause and then continue for added effect,\\n“and months.”\\nWith him , I don’ t say out loud, but the words hang in the air .\\nI want it to sound like a threat, even if it’s an empty one. She doesn’ t\\nneed to know Kaleb scares me or treats me worse than the animals he hunts.\\nAt least they’re of value to him.\\nRising back up, I look her in the eye, knowing that from November\\nthrough April, I’ll have the upper hand. If I wanted it. Do you really want to\\npiss me off?\\n“I dare you,” she threatens.\\n“I’m not sure I’ll have to do anything.”\\nAnd I dart my eyes behind her, gesturing to Kaleb’ s dark greens that\\nhold us in a trance like there’ s no one or nothing else at the party . She\\nfollows my gaze, seeing him watching us, and even though my threat is\\nbaseless, my last sentence isn’ t.\\nHe came after me once already , after all.\\nSuddenly , a hand grips my upper arm and yanks me, and I suck in a\\nbreath, looking up at my uncle.\\n“Everything with a dick is watching you two,” Jake growls, looking\\ndown at me.\\nWatching? Huh?\\nIt takes a moment, but I start moving my eyes around the bonfire, seeing\\npeople looking at Cici and me, especially a few groups of guys on the\\noutskirts of the circle grinning and whispering to each other .\\nI glare up at him, working my arm free. “W ould you have stopped us if I\\nwere dancing with a guy?”\\n“If you had been dancing with a man like that in public, I would’ve\\ntaken you over my knee.”\\nHe casts a quick  look at Cici and then back down to me. “We’re going\\nhome.”\\nTaking my hand, he pulls me along, back toward the tent.\\nWhat the hell? I might care if I do something that reflects poorly on\\nhim, but I wasn’ t doing anything wrong. So a few guys got their rocks off\\nwatching a couple of girls dancing. I honestly wasn’ t even trying to dance\\nwell, so caught up in our conversation as I was. He pushes through the crowd, and my wrist burns. I pull away , yanking\\nfree, and stomp past him toward the truck. Opening the back door, I climb\\nin behind the driver ’s seat and slam the door .\\nThey can pack up the tent themselves.\\nI shake my head.\\nThat’ s the second time I’ve gotten yelled at for drawing attention I\\ndidn’ t ask for. This possessive obsession with protecting my innocence is\\nridiculous. Just because they’re “experienced” doesn’ t mean they’re any\\nmore mature or wise. I would even debate they’re less so. That’ s been pretty\\nclear since I arrived.\\nThe truck shake s and rocks as he and Noah pack the tent, table, chairs,\\nand other gear in the back, and I look out the window , seeing some guy ride\\noff on Noah’ s bike with a girl on the back. They look vaguely  familiar—\\nmaybe a friend borrowing his motorcycle.\\nLaughter goes off outside the truck as the tailgate closes, and I look\\nover, seeing a woman climbing in beside me.\\nA whiff of her perfume hits me, and she looks up, smiling at me as she\\ncloses the door .\\n“Hi.”\\n“Hey .”\\nMore giggles sound off behind me, and as Jake and Noah hop into the\\nfront seat, I close my eyes, my anger so hot I clench my fists.\\nPerfect. Absolut ely perfect. I don’t turn around to see how many are in\\nthe truck bed. I just shoot my uncle a glare in the rearview mirror .\\nHe meets my eyes but then looks away as he starts the truck.\\nDancing with someone makes me look like a slut, but they can serial\\nscrew every night and not see the irony there.\\nJake starts the truck, and I have no idea if Kaleb is still at the bonfire or\\nin the bed behind me, but I cross my arms over my chest, too angry to even\\ncare.\\nMusic plays on the radio as we speed up the dark highway , climbing the\\nmountain on our way home. A cheer goes off behind me in the night wind,\\nand I hear Noah crack a beer from the passenger seat in front.\\nSo I’m just supposed to listen to all of them go at it all night?\\n“Take me over your knee…” I repeat, looking at Jake’ s eyes in the\\nrearview mirror . “I’ve never been spanked in my life.”\\nHe looks up, meeting my gaze. “If you want to be, keep it up.” The girl next to me shifts in her seat, and the tension in the cab suddenly\\nrises a couple notches.\\nAsshole.\\n“You’ll hit me, because I would do things you don’ t like?”\\n“It’s called correction,” he retorts, staring back at the road. “And I’ll do\\nit, because I care about you.”\\nNoah glances over his shoulder at me and then looks over at his father ,\\nwhispering, “What’ s going on?”\\nJake shakes his head once, blowing him of f.\\n“You can’t stop me from being with someone or having sex if I want\\nto,” I inform him. “It’s called a double standard, Jake. You guys get to be\\nwith women. Why can’ t I enjoy someone’ s company?”\\n“We can be with women, because no one has laid claim to us.”\\n“No one has laid claim to me.”\\n“You’re a young woman in my house,” he fires back. “We claim you\\nuntil you’re old enough.”\\n“On my birthday?”\\nHe cocks a dark eyebrow at me, but doesn’ t reply as he focuses back on\\nthe road.\\nWill I be old enough when I’m eighteen in a matter of weeks? Will he\\nback of f then?\\nOf cours e not. I’m old enough when he says, because I’m too stupid to\\nkeep myself out of trouble.\\nAnd whether or not I’m ready for sex is one thing, but intimacy is\\nanother . We all want to be special to someone. Family isn’t the same thing.\\nI’d like to meet someone eventually .\\n“Your logic is flawed, you know?” I tell him, staring at him through the\\nmirror . “If a woman claims you, then she’ll also do for you what other\\nwomen do. But if you all are claiming me, you’re not doing for me what\\nother men would do.”\\nNoah spurts beer from his mouth, choking and dripping alcohol\\neverywhere as he looks wide-e yed over at his father and coughs into his\\nhand.\\nI bite back a smile.\\nNoah hacks, struggling for breath, and wipes the mess off his lap. Jake\\nstares at me through the rearview mirror .\\nBut he doesn’ t reply . And I’m not the first to look away this time.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\n“Ah!” a whimper rings through my ears, and I shoot up in bed, popping my\\neyes open.\\nI cough, sweat covering my brow .\\nThe smell… I let out a sob as my eyes burn. My hair hangs in my face,\\nblowing out with my heavy breaths, and my stomach aches as the knots\\ntighten.\\nWhat the hell? I cough again, unable to catch my breath.\\nGod. Only remnants of my dream remain, but I can still smell that\\nstench. The pungent, soapy candles gagging me…\\nNausea rolls through me as I press the back of my hand to my mouth,\\nand something rises in my throa t. Commotion echoes in the house, but pain\\nwracks my body , and I can’t take it. Throwing off my covers, I stumble out\\nof bed, falling to my hands and knees, and scramble toward the trashcan.\\nI grab the one by my desk and hover over it, heaving.\\nThe odor clogs my nostrils and fills my throat. I don’t rememb er what\\nthe dream was about, but I couldn’ t breathe. I still can’ t. I gasp.\\nThe bile rises up, and I lurch , coughing and gagging over the can,\\ngripping both sides. Why do I still smell it? It’s all over me like it was all\\nover every inch of furniture in my parents’ room, and I start crying, rubbing\\nthe chill of f my arms as dirt weighs my skin.\\nI shake, my sobs breaking loose as the nausea subsides and sadness\\ntakes over. I feel like I’m in that house again. I hadn’ t realized how I hadn’ t\\nfelt that in days now . The cold. The sterile silence and the serrated air stinging my nostrils.\\nThat house where the walls were  too hard and there was nothing that wasn’ t\\nsharp.\\nI suck in deep breaths and tuck my hair behind my ear, the scent of the\\nwood and the trees outside slowly overshadowing the mem ory of the\\ncandles.\\nFalling to my ass, I lean back against the wall, my arms proppe d up on\\nmy knees as I squeeze my eyes shut and tears wet my cheeks.\\nUgh, that feeling.\\nI don’t want to feel it again.  I shake my head. I don’t want to go back\\nthere ever again.\\nI’m here. I’m in Colorado, with them and the wind and the warm fire\\nand the new smells.\\nThe floor creaks above me, and I open my eyes, slowly raising them up\\nto the dark ceiling.\\nKaleb. His room is above mine. A piece of furniture shifts across the\\nfloor , another creak here and a stomp there, but then I hear a cry behind me\\nand feel something hit the wall.\\nNoah’ s next to me, and I rest the back of my hand against the wall by\\nmy head, feeling his headboard hitting on the other side again and again, the\\nthuds speeding up.\\nI drop my hand, listening to their panting and moaning. Tears well\\nagain, but I let them fall without another sob.\\nI wish he was alone. He’d probably let me crawl into bed with him\\ntonight, if I wanted. Like a big brother keeping the wolves at bay, because I\\nhad a scary dream.\\nI wouldn’ t try, even if he were alone, but…\\nIt’s a nice little fantasy .\\nWarm.\\nSafe.\\nComfort.\\nNoah’ s like that.\\nI stand up and lean my forehead into the wall, listening to the boys\\nmake love to girls and the ache filling me up, because I’m alone in here,\\nforgotten and… jealous. Why am I jealous?\\nI squeeze my eyes shut, the tears streaming down over my parch ed lips,\\nand shake my head. Walking over, I open my bedroom door and head into the hallway , the\\nnoise filling the house louder now. Girls giggle in Noah’ s room as a cry\\nechoes from above, followed by moaning, and I pass by, fog in my head as I\\nslowly drift down the stairs.\\nThe cool air hits my bare legs, but it’s a welcome relief as it eases my\\nmuscles. I should put a robe on, but I don’t give a shit. I have my first\\nassignment for school due tomo rrow that’s far from finished, and I should\\nprobably log back into Twitter to see if that girl made good on any of her\\nthreats, but I just can’ t muster a care in the world about any of it tonight.\\nI walk through  the dark living room, the fire from earlier now\\nextinguished as the black hollow  of the fireplace looms to my right, stained\\nwith soot. The clock chimes the hour, but I lose count as I head into the\\nkitchen, trying to swallow through the dryness in my throat.\\nFilling up a glass of water , I lift it to my lips and take severa l gulps,\\nswallowing fast and emptying the glass. I immediately fill it up again and\\ntip my head back, drinking until I finally feel satisfied.\\nI stare out the window above the sink. In a matter of weeks, snow will\\ncover the ground. The house will be quiet, no women for miles or months.\\nThey’re like demons. How do they do it year after year?\\nHow will I do it this year?\\nThey’re not my parents. They engage me, and every time they do a\\nflood of feelings I’m not used to navigating comes out and I do or say\\nsomething stupid.\\nOr my body wants to r espond in ways it shouldn’ t.\\nI rinse out my glass and set it back in the dish rack, leaning against the\\nsink ledge and gazing out the window , staring at nothing.\\nLocked up here for months with them, I’ll go crazy . They’ll drive me\\ninsane. Someone will end up dead.\\nSomething sounding like keys jingle to my right, and I startle, jerking\\nmy head around.\\nJake sits in the dark corner at the kitchen table, and I straigh ten, my\\nheart hammering in my chest. He stares at me.\\nHis finger is threaded through the ring of his car keys as he flips them\\nand catches them in his fist with a beer bottle sitting nearby , and I take in\\nhis jeans, minus the shirt.\\nHeat rises to my cheeks, every inch of my visible skin suddenly  feeling\\nso much  more exposed now as he watches me. I thought he was in his room.\\nHe doesn’t look like he’s been in his room at all, though. He still has his\\nwork boots on.\\nI hold in my shiver, but the points of my breasts harden to rocks through\\nmy tank top, and I fold my arms over my chest. I can’t tell if he sees, but a\\nmoment later he rubs his finger over his lips.\\n“What…” I choke out and clear my throat. “What are you doing?”\\nThe music turns  on upstairs blasting “Devil in a Bottle,” but Jake just\\nsits there, and I can see where Kaleb gets his silence. Not talking and not\\ncommunicating are two dif ferent things.\\nI take a step over toward the island, shielding myself. “Where’ s your…\\nfriend?” I ask softly .\\n“Home.”\\nThe women all came from the race with us, so he must’ve had to take\\nher back to town himself. W onder what cut the night so short.\\n“Not in the mood?” I tease.\\nBut inste ad of smiling it off, he cocks his head at me, something  playing\\nbehind his eyes that makes my stomach drop a little.\\nHe hasn’t gone off on me. Why? I’m down here half-dressed in my\\npanties. Why isn’ t he barking at me to get some clothes on? Or go to bed?\\n“I was hungry ,” I explain, barely able to meet his eyes. “Are you?”\\nAgain, he just sits there, his eyes on me and only me.\\nBut he doesn’ t say no, and he doesn’ t tell me to go get dressed.\\nTell me I’m acting up. Tell me to get my ass upstairs and into some\\npajamas.\\nBut he doesn’ t.\\nAnd I back up, my heart thum ping but feeling bold as I turn for the\\nfridge and pull out some eggs. I dare myself, sure that he’ll yell at me any\\nsecond.\\nI push it further , walking around the island to get the pan, still waiting\\nfor him to tell me to get upstairs.\\nBut he doesn’ t, and my eyes burn. Maybe I’m picking a fight.\\nOr maybe I like to be looked at.\\nI don’ t go upstairs, though.\\nMoving around the dark kitchen , I keep the lights off as I set the pan on\\nthe burner—fryi ng up some butter as I crack and whisk eggs. I add some\\ngarlic and Creole seasoning, aware of his eyes on my back and on my every movement. I have no idea what  my hair looks like after sleep and the fit I\\nhad afterward, but I love the way it feels hanging over my shoulders and\\ndown my back. Kind of like what someone touching me would feel like.\\nMy light pink silk panties hug my ass, the bikini straps sitting just\\nbelow my hips and leaving two inches of skin between them and my gray\\ncami exposed. I reach up, puttin g the spices away as the muscles in my legs\\nand ass flex, wanting him to see it.\\n“Why are you awake?” he asks in a raspy voice.\\nI scrape the eggs over the pan. “Who can sleep with all this noise going\\non?”\\nI might be able to sleep through Kaleb, but I definitely can’t sleep\\nthrough Noah.\\nI look over at Jake as he rubs his thumb up and down one of the keys,\\nKaleb’ s warm fury playing behind his eyes.\\nTheir noise is dif ferent than Noah’ s. It’s silent but deafening.\\nI drop my gaze again, heat spreading across my face as I traipse\\nbarefoot to the fridge once more and grab the cheese, grating a handful over\\nthe eggs and stirring as I turn off the heat. His eyes are boring into me. I can\\nfeel it, and every inch of my skin is alert. I squeeze my eyes shut for a split\\nmoment, warmth spreading low in my belly .\\nSome melted cheese gets on my fingers, and I hiss at the burn. Quickly ,\\nI lick it of f my forefinger and suck it of f my thumb, piling half the eggs on a\\nplate for Jake.\\n“Here you go,” I only manage a whisper as I lift it up.\\nBut he’s suddenly there, behind me. He takes the plate and sets it back\\ndown on the counter .\\nI freeze.\\nHis chest covers my back, and I smell him like I did today when we\\nfished, warm skin touching mine and tingles spreading down my arms and\\nthighs, only now , I don’ t think I’ll run away .\\nI want to feel this.\\n“Why’d you run from me today at the lake?” he asks.\\nI remain quiet.\\nBut my skin hums, and all I can feel is him as the music pounds\\nupstairs.\\n“Why did you run?”\\nI shake my head. I don’ t know . I… “Tiernan…” he says in a strangled whisper .\\nLike a regret. Like he knows exactly why I ran.\\n“I don’t think this is a good idea, after all,” he says behind me. “We’re\\nnot…good influences on a girl.”\\n“I’m not a girl.”\\n“Have you ever had a man in your bed?” he asks in a ragged voice.\\nMy heart skips a beat.\\nSlowly , I shake my head.\\nHe leans down close to my ear . “Have you ever been kissed?”\\nI nod.\\n“On places other than your mouth?”\\nHeat pools between my legs. “No, Uncle Jake.”\\nHis body rises and falls behind  me as he breathes into my hair, and I\\ndon’t turn around, because I’m afraid of breaking the spell.\\nReaching out, he rests his hand on top of mine on the counter , fitting our\\nfingers together  as a finger from his other hand softly glides down my\\nspine. A light layer of sweat cools my skin.\\nDoors slam upstairs as footfall s run from a bedroom to probably the\\nbathroom, and I hear the shower start running as a girl’ s laughter breaks out.\\n“I’m sorry you have to see all this,” Jake says in a pained voice. “When\\nthe snow is coming, we soak it up, because we know we won’ t see anything\\npretty all winter .”\\nHis finger traces slowly down my spine.\\nAll winter…\\nI look down at his possessive hand on mine, remembering his eyes on\\nme from  the table a moment ago, and think of how it feels like something is\\nbarely being contained, and it hasn’ t even snowed yet.\\nThey won’t be locked up here without a woman this year. They ’ll have\\none.\\nHis hot breath filters through the strands of my hair to the back of my\\nneck, and the flesh of my nipple s pebble as his hands tease me so painfully\\ngently .\\nAll winter…\\n“I think you should leave, T iernan.”\\nI narrow my eyes, but I turn my hand over, craving his touch  on my\\npalms now . It feels so good, my eyelids flutter .\\n“Leave the peak?” I ask. Or does he mean leave the kitchen?\\nHe doesn’ t answer , and my stom ach sinks a little, finally realizing what\\nhe’s telling me.\\nNeedles prick the back of my throat. “You said I was home.” I catch his\\nhand mid-caress, thread our fingers, and curl mine to hold his hand tightly .\\n“You said I was yours.”\\n“This is no place for you.”\\nTear well again, but I push them away . He talked me out of leaving\\nyesterday morning, and now he wants me to go. He wants me to be alone.\\nI’m always alone, and you made me know what it was like not to be, and\\nyou lied.\\n“Why did my father give me to you?” I whisper , staring out the window\\nand seeing my uncle’ s reflectio n loom behind me. “They knew  what they\\nwere going to do. They could’ve waited a few weeks until I was eighteen.\\nThey could’ve given me to Mirai.”\\nI lean back into him more, savoring his warmth and his eyes on my\\nbody .\\n“Maybe they didn’ t think about  it,” I murmur . “Or maybe they knew it\\nwas the only good thing they could do for me.”\\nAt least I was mentioned in the will. I wouldn’ t be surprised if I weren’ t.\\nI yank out of his hand, pushing away from the counter , and char ge away ,\\nbut I don’t make it two steps. He grabs my arm, pulls my back into his\\nchest, and I gasp as he wraps his arms around my body and forces my face\\naround to look up at him.\\n“Do you feel this?” he growls over my lips as he pushes me into the\\nsink. The thick, hard ridge of his cock nudges my ass, and I groan. “This is\\nwhat you’re doing to me, Tiernan. It’s not right. Instead of pile-driving the\\nhot tits and ass I came home with, I’m sitting down here, trying to talk\\nmyself out of going into your room and giving the teenage piece of ass\\nliving in my house a really long kiss goodnight.”\\nMy clit throbs, and I shift on my feet, feeling the slickness betw een my\\nlegs.\\n“And do I take of f my panties for that?” I breathe out.\\nHe squeezes his eyes shut, groaning as if in pain, and I only have a\\nmoment to suck in a quick breat h before his mouth covers mine, a whimper\\nat the sweet pain escaping me.\\nFuck. Fuck…\\nMy heart damn near jumps out of my chest as he moves, taking my lips,\\nand the heat of his tongue swirling down into my belly to betwe en my legs.\\nI cry out, but it’ s lost in his mouth.\\nOh, my God.\\nHis taste fills my body , and I slide my hand up, taking the back of his\\nneck and holdin g him to me. I’m so hungry . So hungry , and I can’t breathe.\\nMy blood races under my skin, and it feels so good, but God, I need more.\\nI need more.\\nI start to move my mouth and kiss him back, slipping my tongue past\\nhis lips little by little, moaning and tasting him until I don’t think I’ll ever\\nget enough.\\nHis mouth eats me up, moving over me, kissing the corners of my\\nmouth and nibbling the flesh of my bottom lip, and I put my hand on his at\\nmy stomach and guide him down, pushing him to the V between my legs.\\nHis kissing falters as he gasps, and I use the reprieve to try to catch my\\nbreath. He bites my bottom lip again, our hands massaging my pussy as his\\nother leaves my face and grabs my breast, squeezing it.\\nI moan. “Jake.”\\nLeaving my mouth, he trails down my neck, and all I can do is let my\\nhead fall back and take it as he pulls the strap of my tank top down, the\\nfaint sound of a tear hitting my ears, but I don’t care. He nibbles, bites, and\\nsucks on my neck, shoulders, and over my shoulder blades as he continues\\nkneading my breast and making  my panties so wet as he rubs me through\\nthem.\\n“Jesus, fuck.” He pushes me over the sink, gripping my waist with both\\nhands as he trails his mouth down my back, my thighs, and back up to my\\nass, taking a mouthful between his teeth.\\nI cry out, the torn straps of my tank top hanging down as I grip the ledge\\nof the counter .\\nRising back up, he turns my face toward him again and kisses  me as I\\nreach behind me, finding his erection through his jeans and rubbing him.\\nHe grips my hand. “No, T ier—”\\n“I’ve never touched a man before,” I breathe out. “I wanna touch you.”\\nHe lets out a sigh, but he relea ses me, kissing me deep and hard, his\\ntongue lighting every nerve in my body as he grips and feels and runs his\\nhands over every part of me that he can reach. He thrusts into me from behin d, and I’m a mess—a puddle—in his\\narms, ready for him.\\n“Take me to bed,” I beg.\\nHe thrusts again as I reach behind and hold onto his neck.\\n“Take me to bed and give me that kiss goodnight.”\\n“Yeah,” he grunts, dry-fucking me against the sink.\\nMy head swims behind my closed eyes, and I’m too high to think or\\ncare about anything except making this last forever .\\nHe cove rs my mouth again, and I take his hand and guide it down inside\\nmy panties.\\nBut he suddenly tears his mouth away and pulls his hands off me.\\n“Fuck, stop.” He backs away , breathing hard as the chill sudde nly hits my\\nskin. “No. No, we can’ t.”\\nI shudde r, the ache of need nearly making my knees give out. Tears\\nspring to my eyes.\\n“This isn’t happening,” he grow ls. “I’m your uncle. I’m your fucking\\nuncle.”\\n“You were neve r my uncle,” I grit out, spinning around. “You’re a no-\\nrelation stranger my parents sent me to live with.”\\nHis face is flushed, like mine I’m sure, and sweat glistens on his tanned\\ntemples.\\n“You’re my responsibility ,” he tells me.\\n“But it felt good.”\\nPain hits his eyes, and I know he felt it, too. “It felt good tonight,” he\\nsays, “but it’ll feel like shit in the morning.”\\nI shake my head, not caring. I don’ t care.\\n“I’m lonely and an emotional ly stunted child, and you’re the first\\nwoman I’ve been around long enough to get connected to in the past twenty\\nyears.” He stand s up straight, running a hand through his hair. “And you’re\\njust a neglected orphan, desperate for attention. That’ s all this is.”\\n“Desperate…” I stare at him, my face cracking.\\nNo.\\nI’m not desperate. I’ve had opportunities, but I never wanted it. Until\\nnow. I chose this.\\nBut he looks at me hard. “You scream at night,” he says. “In your sleep.\\nYou never talk about them. You’re running from that life as fast as you can,\\nand I won’ t be your gateway drug. I’ll hate myself.” I chew on my lip. He hears me at night?\\n“This is acting out.”\\n“It’s not.” I shake my head, hearing a door slam shut upstairs.\\nHe inche s close again, speaking low. “You threw away your candy ,” he\\nsays. “You don’t accept Noah’ s invitations to the track when  he goes to\\npractice. You don’t engage Kaleb when he’s fighting you. You still barely\\njoin us for meals or in front of the TV at night.”\\nI drop my eyes and clench my teeth, overwhelmed. Why is he doing\\nthis? Everything felt so good a minute ago.\\n“You don’t laugh or play or want anyone or have passion for anything,”\\nhe goes on. “You have no hobbies, no interests, no boyfriends at home…\\nEver, am I right?”\\nI look away , but he comes in and cups my face. I jerk away , but he holds\\ntight, and I can’ t stop it from spilling over . Tears starts to stream.\\n“You never smile,” he says quietly as the music and noise rage in the\\nfaraway recesse s of the house.  “You never feel joy. No dreams for the\\nfuture. No plans. Y ou have no fight in you. Y ou’re barely alive, T iernan.”\\nI struggle for air , sobbing as he holds me.\\n“It wasn’t always like that, though, was it?” he asks but doesn’ t wait for\\nme to answer . “It couldn’ t have been. You must’ve loved things. Wanted\\nthings. Things that made you happy .”\\nHe kisses my forehead.\\n“You are beautif ul,” he tells me, “and pulling my body away from yours\\nwas the most pain I’ve ever been in, but I did it, because it was the right\\nthing to do.”\\n“It didn’ t feel that way .”\\n“Because feeling  anything felt good,” he throws back. “You have a lot\\nof big emotions going through that young mind of yours right now, and you\\nneeded a release. Y ou broke. I could’ve been anyone.”\\nI shake my head, pulling away from him. “It was more than that.”\\nBut he looks at me sternly . “Why did you throw the cand y away ,\\nTiernan?”\\nWhat?\\n“I…” I search for my words. “I didn’ t want it. You…you made  me get\\nit.”\\n“That’ s bullshit. Why did you throw it away?” “Because I didn’ t want it!” I say again. “It’s just candy . What the hell?\\nWhat does it matter?”\\n“You threw it away , because it did matter ,” he barks.\\nI start to walk away .\\nBut he grabs my arm. “Don’ t you see? That’ s what happened.” He turns\\nme around, but I turn my head away , refusing to look at him. “At some\\npoint, you started denying yourself anything that made you happy. Out of\\nspite, maybe? Or pride? Candy? T oys? Pets? Af fection? Love? Friends?”\\nI flex my jaw , but I’m breathing hard as he shakes me.\\n“And I know that, because I did it, too,” he tells me. “You don’t want to\\nsmile, because if you do, it means everything they did to you didn’ t matter .\\nAnd it has to matter or else they’re off the hook, right? And you can’t have\\nthat.”\\nI shake my head, but I still can’ t meet his eyes.\\n“They need to know what they did to you,” Jake says, acting like he\\nknows me. “Showing them how they hurt you will hurt them, right? They\\nneed to see how they ruined your life. You can’t just let it go like it was\\nnothing, because  you’re angry . You need them to know . You need someone\\nto know .”\\nNo. That’ s not…\\nI have hobbies. I have things I like. I…\\n“So you’ll waste your life,” he continues, “blow off your futur e, going\\nthrough the motions, and diving into anything that makes you feel good for\\neven a moment…”\\nI shake my head, the tears pooling more and more.\\nNo. I have interests. I let myself enjoy things. I…\\n“And then someday after the fights and the job you hate and the\\ndivorces and the kids that can’ t stand you…”\\nI just keep shaking my head. I don’t care what they did or didn’ t do. I\\ndon’t need this.\\nBut the memory  of our vacation  to Fiji when I was eleven pops  into my\\nhead and how they only took me, because the press had caught on that I was\\nrarely ever with my parents.\\nAnd how one morning I woke up in the suite alone and waited for them\\nfor two days, because they took an overnight trip around all the islands and\\nforgot about me.\\nI was so scared. “You’re going to look in the mirror at the seventeen-year -old girl in a\\nfifty-year -old body and realize you wasted so much time being  devastated\\nat how those fuckers didn’ t love you that you forgot there’ s an entire world\\nof people who will.”\\nI crack. My eyes close, my body shakes, and I just sob, letting it go. The\\nanger , the pain, the exhaustion of them taking up nearly every ounce of my\\nbrain, because for so long, there was nothing else I lived for, than for them\\nto notice me.\\nHe’s right.\\nI look up at him, tears spilling down my face. “They didn’ t leave me a\\nnote,” I say , “Why did they do that?”\\nHe picks  me up, sets me on the countertop, and wraps his arms around\\nme again, one hand gripping my hair as I bury my face in his neck.\\nI cry so hard it’ s silent, and I can’ t keep it back even if I try .\\n“Because they were fuckers, baby,” he says, his voice thick. “They were\\nfucking fuckers.”\\n“I don’ t know who I am,” I sob.\\n“Shhhh…”\\nHe soothes me, rubbing his fingers in my hair and holding me tight. My\\narms hang limply at my side as every speck of energy drains, everything\\nI’ve been holding in over the years and didn’ t want to feel. It hurts.\\n“Shhhh…” he whispers in my ear . “It’s okay .”\\nHe keeps me there, and I don’t know how long I cry, but when the tears\\nstart to slow , embarrassment warms my cheeks.\\nI try to lift up, but his hold stays firm, not letting me escape.\\nAnd just like that. I let every thing go. The worry , the doubt, the\\nshame… I’m a fucking basket case, but he’ s not going anywhere.\\nSlowly , I circle his waist with my arms, locking my hands behind his\\nback as I breathe in the scent of his neck.\\nWarm. He’s so warm and they’ re so warm. Everything is warm here.\\nAnd even if we’re not finishing  what we started, this feels just as good. I\\nthink Mirai was the last one to hug me. I let her do it on my last birthday ,\\nbut I don’ t think I let her give me a real one in years.\\nI calm after a while, the pain fading, because I know the truth. My\\nparents didn’ t love me.\\nAnd that wasn’ t my fault. But they did one thing right , I think  as I hang onto my uncle and he\\nholds onto me.\\n“So, you want me to tuck you in then?” Jake asks. “I can do that.”\\nI can’t help it. I let a laugh escape, and I feel his chest shake with one,\\ntoo.\\nI lift my head up and wipe my eyes, seeing the drying tears streaked\\ndown his chest.\\nI wipe it of f. “Sorry .”\\n“It’s okay .”\\nSniffling, I take a dish towel and clean both of us up. “You know, I was\\ntrying to be happy ,” I inform him. “Meet a guy and all, but you wouldn’ t let\\nme.”\\n“I was afraid guys for you right now would just be you acting out. I\\ndidn’ t want you to do something you’d regret.”\\nI stare up into blue eyes. So if this was just me acting out, what was it\\nfor you?\\nI swallow . I can still feel his hands on me.\\n“And maybe I was scared, too,” he tells me, giving me a cocky little\\nsmile. “Everyone will want you, and it’ s our time with you.”\\nA flutter hits my belly . I like it when they say stuf f like that.\\n“You okay with that?” he asks.\\nI nod. Having a family is nice.\\nHe pulls me down off the count er and gives me a swat in the ass. “Now\\ngo back to bed.”\\nI give a weak smile and feel his touch again as he tries to put my strap\\nback over my shoulder . But it just falls back over my breast.\\n“And you probably shouldn’ t walk around dressed like this,” he says,\\nhis voice quiet again.\\nI look up, meeting his eyes.\\nHe cocks his head. “Especially this winter .”  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI rest my head against Jake’ s back, my face turned up to the sky. Small\\npuffs of white clouds dot the blue, and the cool air fills my lungs with water\\nand wood. I don’ t remember ever being so relaxed.\\nI didn’t get much sleep after he sent me to bed last night, but I’m not\\nmissing it. Everything seems lighter now .\\n“Stop taking the reins,” Jake snips.\\nI smile, my arms tight around him as I grip the leather straps.\\n“But I like to steer .”\\n“That’ s not how you steer a horse,” he chides over his shoulder .\\n“Thought you knew how to ride.”\\n“I thought I did, too, but you won’ t let me ride one on my own,” I tease,\\nresting my chin on his shoulder .\\nOur rifles bob against my back as we ride around the barn and back up\\nthe driveway to the house. After chores this morning, Noah drove all the\\ngirls back to town, and Jake took me into the forest for target practice. I\\nhadn’ t seen—or heard—Kaleb since last night.\\nBut as we ride past the large pile of gravel Jake had dropped off to\\nrecover the driveway this morni ng, I look over and see Kaleb, standing up\\non a ladder and fixing the pane of glass in the ceiling of the greenhouse.\\nHe doesn’ t look back.\\n“You hungry?” Jake asks.\\nHe stops, climbing down, and I take his hand, letting him help me of f. “Yeah.” I’ve been hungry since breakfast, and I ate something then, too.\\nA lot, actually . I could eat like three—\\n“Cheesebur gers!” I hear Noah scream all of a sudden.\\nI whip my head around and see him step out of the barn, holding his\\nfists in the air .\\nI smile and then look back at Jake.\\nHe shakes his head and pulls his keys out of his pocket, droppi ng them\\nin my hand. “Go,” he tells me.\\nI start for the truck but stop and swing back, planting a quick kiss on\\nJake’ s cheek.\\nHe freezes, giving me a look.\\nI whip off Noah ’s flannel and tie it around my waist as I back away ,\\nsmiling. “You said I should do things that make me happy . You told me to\\nfind my bliss.”\\n“I’m pretty sure I would never say that.”\\nBut I spot the little smile playing on his lips as he turns and grabs a rake\\nto start spreading the new gravel.\\nOpening the door of the truck, I climb in, but Noah is suddenly there,\\nforcing me over . I scoot down as he takes the keys from me.\\nBut as I slide over to the passen ger’s seat instead, that door opens and\\nKaleb is there. We lock eyes, and he jerks his chin, ordering me to make\\nroom. My nerves fire. I settle in the middle.\\nBoth boys take their seats with me in the middle, and Noah fires up the\\ntruck, Kaleb’ s arm resting on the seat behind me.\\nI cast a look over my shoulder at Jake through the rear window , trying\\nto recapture the ease I felt just a few minutes ago.\\n“Don’ t take forever!” he shouts and pulls off his shirt, stuffing it into his\\nback pocket as he picks up the rake again to move the gravel. “I need help\\nwith all this!”\\nI hear Noah scoff as he starts the truck, and without a word, he speeds\\noff, probably determined to take as long as possible now .\\nWe wind through the forest, heading down the mountain on the narrow\\nroads as the sunlight flashes through the trees and Noah reach es between\\nmy knees to shift the old truck.\\nI keep thinking about Jake’ s last words last night.\\nEspecially all winter . They’re living it up now, because they know they’ll have to go without,\\nbut…\\nIf Jake hadn’ t pulled away last night, we wouldn’ t have stopped.\\nI mean, I guess he’s right. We’re both lonely , and we acted out. I need\\nfamily a lot more than I need sex, and going through with what we were\\ndoing last night would’ve complicated everything. He was right to stop it.\\nRight? I still taste his whisper on my mouth. You are beautiful and\\npulling my body away fr om yours was the most pain I’ve ever been in.\\nI rub my palms together in my lap as little butterflies go off in my\\nstomach.\\nI don’t know . I felt great waking up today , knowing I didn’t do\\nsomething I might’ve regretted, but… If it happens again, I still don’t think\\nI’ll be the one to stop it.\\n“So, are you and my dad okay?” someone asks.\\nI blink, realizing it came from my left.\\nI look at Noah. “Huh?”\\nWhy wouldn’ t his dad and I be okay? Does he know something?\\nHe glances over at me, trying to keep his eyes on the road, too. “The\\nlittle thing…” he hints, “in the truck last night?”\\nIt takes me a moment, but then I remember . The argument. When he\\nthreatened to spank me.\\n“He’ s a pain in the ass,” Noah continues. “Seriously . Don’ t let him get\\nto you. I’m continually surprised he ever got hard enough to make us.”\\nAnd then he laughs, shifting into a higher gear as the truck cruis es down\\nthe road and the wind breezes through the cab.\\nA smile pulls at my lips, and I put my head down, trying to hide it. He\\ndidn’ t have any tr ouble last night.\\nI bite my bottom lip to keep the smile from spreading.\\nReaching over, I turn on the music, “Gives You Hell”  playing as we\\npick up the town’ s radio statio n. Noah turns it up, Kaleb rolls down his\\nwindow , and I start to relax as we listen to the music.\\nThe green leaves of the decidu ous trees mixed amongst the conifers\\nshow yellow tinges that will soon turn to oranges and reds before the\\nviolent winds of winter rip them  free. The highest peaks in the state have\\nalready gotten snow , but here, the air just smells of hay and smoky , earthy\\nfood cooked over bonfires that kind of remind me of the fallen apples left to decay under the trees back at Brynmor . It feels like the anticipat ion you feel\\nwhen you’re waiting for something to happen.\\nI tip my head back and close my eyes as Noah sings and the breeze\\ncaresses my bare arms.\\nBut then the truck comes to a sudden stop, I lurch forwa rd, and\\nsomething slams  into my chest. I wince at the pain, my eyes popping open\\nas a car pulls out right in front of us.\\n“Aw, come on!” Noah barks, the truck idling in the middle of the road.\\nThe car backs out of a driveway and pulls forward, taking off down the\\nroad as if we didn’ t almost crash into them.\\nI draw in a deep breath, suddenly aware of the ache in my chest again.\\nI look down and see Kaleb’ s arm is shot out in front of me, keeping me\\nfrom diving head first through the wind-shield. There was no seatbelt for\\nme in the middle.\\nI look over at him as he scowls at the car disappearing down the road.\\nWithout sparing  me a glance, he drops his arm and goes back to looking\\nat his phone.\\nHm.\\nNoah takes off again, but I steal glances at Kaleb every few seconds. So\\nhe does know I exist.\\nWe head through town, turning into Ferg’s Freeze on the left and pulling\\ninto the drive-through.\\nA woma n’s voice comes over the speaker , and I check out the menu\\nquickly .\\n“Cheesebur ger,” I tell him as he hangs out the window .\\n“Okay , seven cheesebur gers,” he calls out.\\nSeven?\\nNoah turns back to me. “Y ou want bacon on yours?”\\nI nod.\\n“All with bacon,” he tells the cashier . “Three—no, four—lar ge fries.”\\n“I don’ t need fries,” I reply .\\n“I’ll eat yours,” he tells me. “And four milkshakes—two vanilla, one\\nstrawberry , and…”\\nHe looks at me over his shoulder .\\n“Strawberry , too,” I answer .\\n“Make that two strawberry and also add a Coke.” She tells him his total, and I sit back in the seat as we pull up behind\\nanother car , waiting our turn.\\nGlancing over at Kaleb, I see he’s still scrolling, and I look down to see\\nwhat has so much of his attention.\\nI smile.\\n“I’ve been there,” I tell him, gesturing to the images on his screen. “It’s\\nthis whole hotel  in Oregon that’s a treehouse. I love the lights in the trees—\\nit’s pretty . Kind of magical.”\\nHe looks over at me, staring silently .\\nHe’s probably mad that I got nosy. I’ve made his breakfas t every\\nmorning this week—which he scarfs down—but for some reason, I’m\\nbarely on his radar unless he wants to…eat.\\n“Have you ever been outside of Colorado?” I broach.\\nBut of course, he doesn’ t answer .\\nWe pull forward, and I hear a chirpy voice.\\n“Hi, Kaleb,” someone says.\\nA pretty  girl with a shoulder -length shaggy cut and bangs peers at us\\nthrough the window , her blue-and-white-striped uniform shirt adorned with\\na name tag that says Marnie.\\nKaleb doesn’ t acknowledge her as Noah pays her. She opens the\\nwindows again to give him his change.\\n“You know the offer still stands,” she says, looking at Kaleb as she\\nhands Noah the bags of food. “Sure you don’t want to tuck me away up on\\nthe peak  with the rest of the necessities you need for winter? I could keep\\nyou warm.”\\nI can tell she’ s only teasing, trying to play .\\nBut Noah laughs, taking the milkshakes and passing them to me, which\\nI hold on my lap. “Yeah, only if he puts you back into the pantry the\\ntwenty-three hours of the day he’ s not using you.”\\n“Noah!” I burst out, my eyes wide.\\nBut the chick is way ahead of me. She flings her hand into the Coke\\nsitting at the window , its contents spilling all over Noah before the windows\\nswing closed again, leaving him in the dust.\\nSplashes land on me, soaking into the seat, and I gasp at the ice and cold\\nas Noah growls.\\n“Seriously!” he whines, flinging soda of f his hands. “What the hell?” I laugh, barely noticing Kaleb lifting me up and moving me over, out of\\nthe mess.\\n“You deserved that,” I tell Noah, but I’m still laughing.\\nHe groans, pulling napkins out of the bag to dry himself. “I was just\\njoking.”\\n“Well, I like her ,” I tease.\\nA horn honks behind us, and Noah scowls as he pulls off, probably\\npissed he didn’ t get that Coke now .\\nKaleb wipes my arm down with a napkin, and I stop laughing, realizing\\nI’m sitting in his lap. I look down on the red seat, seeing a dark pool of\\nCoke where I was sitting.\\nHe throws the wet napkin down and picks up another , pressing it to my\\nthigh to soak up the mess on my jeans. My breath catches, and I put my\\nhand on his to stop him.\\n“I’m…”\\nHe looks up at me, and the last time he was this close was when he had\\nme on the hood of the car .\\n“I’m…I’m okay ,” I assure him, sopping up my jeans.\\nHe remo ves his hand, letting me do it as he circles my waist like a\\nseatbelt and goes back to playing on his phone, holding it with both hands\\naround me.\\n“I can sit back down.”\\nI try to move off him, but he stops me, not taking his eyes off his phone\\nas he pats the seat to remind me it’ s wet.\\nContinuing to scroll, he keeps his arms firmly in place, and my pulse\\nraces.\\nAnd as we drive  home, all I’m aware of is him. Noah’ s not in the car.\\nThere’ s no music. Despite the breeze, the truck is hot inside.\\nAt some point I look over at him, and he raises his eyes, holding mine\\nagain.\\nAnd I know then that I was wrong. I’m on his radar .\\n \\n \\n“No!” I bellow , twisting my legs away before he can get a proper hold.\\nBut I’m not fast enough. Jake grabs my ankles as I grapple for the rip in\\nthe mat to hang onto and try to kick free of him. He yanks me down, and I scream in the garage, breaking out in a laugh I\\ncan’t hold back.\\nIt’s been almost two days since our episode in the kitchen . We’ve\\nworked, cooked, jarred some fruit, stocked the pantry with supplies for\\nwinter , and bottled up some water , since I’m told the pipes often freeze.\\nThey’ve forced me to watch the entire first season of their karate show ,\\nand I made some new popsicle treats I found on Pinterest for the horses and\\nchickens that Noah made fun of me for, but the animals loved. I watched\\nthem for a solid hour picking at the frozen corn. It was so cute.\\n“Come on,” Jake barks, grippin g me hard. “You should’ve caught onto\\nthis by now .”\\n“It’s been two days! Gimme a break.”\\nI stop trying to kick and shoot up, swinging both of my fists right for his\\nface. He rears back, but I clip his nose.\\nHe releases me, and I scramble to my feet, facing him with a ready\\nstance.\\nHe holds his nose, his eyes watering. “Ouch,” he grunts.\\nYesterday , he decided I needed a little more raising than the boys, since\\nI’d found myself up at the lake alone with Terrance several days ago, and\\nwanted to teach me some self-defense. Kaleb is off hunting, and Noah’ s\\nwatching TV .\\nJake snif fles and shakes it of f, putting up his hands to go again.\\n“Why not just give me a gun?” I ask. “Isn’ t that the mountain-man\\nanswer for everything?”\\n“Sure, once you put down your avocado toast.”\\nI laugh, shoving him in the chest. “I don’ t eat that.”\\nI feel his chuckle as he whips me around and locks me in a hold.\\n“What are you going to do?” he taunts, tightening his arms around me\\nas I squirm. “Come on. What do you do?”\\nHe only hesitates a moment before he releases me and digs his fingers\\ninto my stomach, tickling me. I curl up, trying not to laugh as both of us fall\\nto the mat, my back crashing on top of his chest.\\n“No, no, no…” I hug myself against his onslaught, squirming and\\nwiggling as I chuckle. “Stop!”\\nHe finally does, placing his hands on my waist as I drop my head back\\nto his chest and we both try to catch our breaths. “Pretty sure you’ll all just need  to chaperone me everywhere, because\\nthis is useless,” I tell him.\\nHis chest shakes  with a silent laugh, and within a moment everything is\\nquiet as I lie there.\\nMy body starts to warm, and my smile falls as I feel him under me,\\naware of every ridge of his muscles. Every bulge of his… body .\\nI turn my head, looking at him, and I see the embarrassment in his eyes,\\nbecause he knows I feel it.\\nI made him hard.\\nMy skin tingles under his fingers, and as he caresses my hips with just\\nthe barest touch, my eyelids flutter .\\nHis eyebrows pinch together . “What is this?” he murmurs.\\nAnd I feel his fingers slip under the string of my panties.\\nHe follows the fabric over my hip where it sticks out of my jeans all the\\nway to the back where there’ s almost nothing.\\nHe knows what kind of panties I’m wearing, and his breathing turns\\nlabored.\\n“I got some in town today ,” I tell him.\\nI like how they feel. How they look. The girls at school were wearing\\nsexy underwear years ago already .\\nBut he looks at me like he’s scared of me, and I rub my nose, seeing his\\nAdam’ s apple move up and down.\\nI didn’ t mean to unnerve him. It’s not about sex. I just like feeling\\ndifferent and buying something T iernan de Haas would never buy .\\nThis is what comes with raising a teenage girl, Jake. He’ll see them in\\nthe laundry at some point.\\n“Tiernan?” Noah calls. “Y our phone is ringing!”\\nI draw in a breath and slide off Jake, hearing him clear his throat as we\\nboth pull up to our feet.\\nRunning into the house, I grab my phone off the island, seeing Mirai’ s\\nname light up on the screen.\\nI answer it. “Hey .”\\n“Tiernan,” she bursts out, sound ing relieved to reach me. How long had\\nthe phon e been ringing? “So good to hear your voice,” she says. “I haven’ t\\nheard from you. I was anxious to see how you’re doing.”\\nJake steps into the kitchen, closing the door and catches my eyes as he\\nwalks for the fridge. My pulse still races. “I’m good,” I tell her .\\n“You like it there? Everything is…fine?”\\n“Yeah.” I linger around the island as Jake cracks open a beer. “They\\nkeep me busy . Lots of sun and fresh air .”\\n“That’ s good.” Her voice is gentle. Sweet. Had it always sounded like\\nthat? “As long as they’re kind to you.”\\n“Yes,” I say , knowing Jake is listening. “They’re kind to me.”\\nI meet his gaze, smiling as he rolls his eyes and smirks.\\n“Listen, I didn’ t want to bother you,” she tells me, “but your parents’\\nfuneral will be the day after tomorrow .”\\nI blink, looking away from my uncle. The funeral. Guilt overtakes me. I\\nhadn’ t thought about it in days.\\nI actually hadn’ t thought about my own parents’ funeral.\\n“I’m really sorry about the rush,” Mirai continues. “With certain\\nattendees, we were pressured to work around their schedules.”\\nI nod. “Of course.”\\nI feel Jake watching me.\\n“You don’ t have to come,” she informs me. “Everyone will understand.”\\nMy stom ach sinks at the thought of getting on a plane. The idea of\\nleaving here—going there… It’ s the last thing I want to do.\\nBut I don’ t hesitate.\\n“Get me a flight, okay? T onight is fine.”\\n“Are you sure?”\\nJake sets his bottle on the coun ter, planting both hands as he stares at\\nme.\\n“Yes,” I tell her . “Talk soon.”\\n“Okay ,” she says. “Give me an hour .”\\nI hang up, and Noah must’ve heard, because he’s walking over as soon\\nas I set the phone down.\\n“You’re leaving?” he asks.\\nBut I look at my uncle. “My parents’ funeral is the day after tomorrow ,”\\nI tell him. “She’ll try to get me a flight tonight. I hate to ask, but can you\\ngive me a ride to the airport?”\\n“You sure you want to go?” He narrows his eyes. “You don’t have to do\\nanything. Y ou can stay . Or I could come with you.”\\n“You can’t,” I say. “The McD ougall customization is behind . I’ll be\\nokay . It’s fine.” He pauses, the wheels in his head turning.\\nAfter a moment, he walks to the wall and grabs a set of keys.\\nHe pushes them over the counter to me. “Take one of the trucks,” he\\nsays. “Park it at the airport, so it’ s there when you come back.”\\nI stare at the keys.\\nThere’ll be things to deal with at home. The house, the account s, Mirai,\\nthe condolences, obligations they had with charities and fundraisers and…\\n“You’re not coming back,” Jake finally says when I don’ t take the keys.\\nI open my mouth but nothing comes out. My throat fills with a softball-\\nsized lump that hurts so much. I don’ t want to leave, but I don’ t…\\n“I don’t know what’s going to happen. For sure.” I finally look up at\\nhim. “There’ s a lot to deal with there. I can’ t say how long I’ll be.”\\nHe stares at me, and Noah has nothing to say for the first time since I’ve\\nbeen here.\\nJake sighs and picks up the keys, shoving his beer over to Noah before\\nwalking off without another look in my direction. “Let me know when\\nyou’re ready to leave.”  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nIt’s not raining.\\nI thought that was how it was supposed to be during a funeral.\\nLike in the movies. It always rains.\\nThe shadows of the trees glide over the windows of the black limo as\\nwe ride through Glendale, on our way to the cemetery . I lean against the\\ndoor, Mirai sitting across from me as the procession carries my parents to\\nthe chapel first, our car following.\\nOf course, it’s a beautiful day. The sun never failed to shine on my\\nmother .\\nBut then I roll my eyes behind my large, black glasses, letting out a\\nquiet sigh. Yeah, I should totally say that in my eulogy . I’ll have the whole\\ncongregation rolling with laughter at all the cheese.\\nJesus.\\nI stare out the window , rubbin g my gloved hands together , but still,\\nnothing comes to mind. Not in the thirty-six hours since I’ve been back in\\nCalifornia. I can’ t think of anything to say that doesn’ t sound like a lie.\\nI mean, they weren’ t without talent and beauty . Why can’t I muster a\\nsingle heartfelt word to offer up at that podium to fulfill my final duty as\\ntheir daughter?\\nI should be able to do that.\\nBut no. Every sweet, saccharin e lie makes me feel like a fraud, and I\\ncan’t utter the words, because I’ve lost the stomach to live in a way that\\nisn’t genuine. “You’re tan,” Mirai says.\\nI turn my eyes on her, seeing her sunglasses dangle from her fingers, her\\nhair pulled back in a tight, low ponytail.\\nI love how she looks. She wears a black pencil skirt and a black jacket,\\na shiny black belt secured around her waist with high heels. Our personal\\nshopper , on the other hand, seems to think I’m still twelve in the dress they\\nprepared for me. I’m covering it up with a long black coat, and since I have\\ngloves on, Mirai must be talking about my face, the only visible skin.\\nI nod.\\n“Did you like it up there?”\\n“Yeah,” I murmur .\\nI liked them .\\nThe empty seat next to me weighs heavy , and I wish Jake was here. He\\noffered, didn’ t he? I had to open my big mouth and refuse.\\nI haven ’t eaten much since I arrived, either . The food here tastes\\ndifferent.\\n“I spoke to him on the phone while you were there,” Mirai tells me.\\n“Your uncle, I mean. I was afraid he’d be a jerk.” She laughs a little. “He\\nhad a real attitude.”\\nI smile to myself, looking back out the window . “Yeah, he does,” I\\nwhisper .\\nBut I’m full of pride. I like him that way .\\n“I invited them,” she says. “I of fered to bring them out.”\\n“They’ll never leave Colorado.”\\nNoah, maybe. Jake, unwillingly . And Kaleb…I can’t see him anywhere\\nelse.\\nMy breathing turns ragged as I think about what time it is there and\\nwhat they’re probably doing right now. Noah would be off doing his test\\nruns, wasting way more time than he was allowed, and Jake will yell at him\\nwhen he gets back before ordering him inside to help me with lunch…\\nBut no. I drop my eyes.\\nI’m not in the kitchen. Noah will make lunch himself.\\nOr run to town for cheesebur gers.\\nI wonder if he got that stain off the seat. Knowing Noah, he just left it.\\nHe’s so lazy about some things.\\n“The reverend will speak first,” Mirai speaks up, “followed by me,\\nGeor ge Palmer , Cassidy Lee, and then Delmont W illiams.” I sit back in my seat and look out the front windshield, past the driver ,\\nto see the hears e carrying my parents. First to the funeral. Then to the\\ncrematorium.\\nMy throat swells.\\n“The reverend will then ask if anyone else would like to say\\nsomething,” she continues in a slow, soft voice. “If you decide you want to\\nspeak, feel free to go ahead then, okay?”\\nHer voice is like she’s explaining this to a child. Like she’s afraid I’ll\\nwake up screaming if she’ s too loud.\\n“You don’t have to do that,” I tell her. “You don’t have to talk like that.\\nI’m not asleep.”\\nShe stares at me, drawing in a deep breath as her eyes start to glisten.\\nAnd then she turns away , so I won’ t see.\\n“Do you remember your night terrors?” she asks, staring out the\\nwindow . “We talked about them when you were little.”\\nThey came back in Colorado. I haven’ t told her that, and I won’ t.\\n“It happened every night,” she explains. “We would wake you up, stop\\nyour screaming, and then put you back to sleep.”\\nI vaguely remember it. I was so young.\\nShe swallows. “One night, I just waited for you to fall asleep,” she says,\\n“and I crawled in next to you.”\\nShe looks back at me.\\n“Nothing. No terrors,” she tells me. “And the next night, the same thing.\\nNo terrors when I slept with you.”\\nMy chin trembles, and I clench my jaw to stop it.\\nA tear falls down her cheek as she can only manage a whisper . “You just\\nneeded what everyone needs,” she tells me. “A home.”\\nI tighten my fists, trying to keep my breathing steady .\\n“It’s not a place, Tiernan. It’s a feeling.” Her voice shakes. “Even when\\nyou grew out of the terrors, you still only managed four or five hours of\\nsleep a night in that house. With them. That’ s why I wasn’ t upset when they\\nsent you away to school when you were only eleven.” She sniffles, a sob\\nescaping as she looks away . “Maybe, finally , you’d sleep.”\\nThe car stops and the door opens, Mirai quickly putting on her\\nsunglasses and wiping tears away as she climbs out.\\nIt takes a moment to get my limbs moving.\\nIt’s a feeling. A feeling. Not a place.\\nI close my eyes a moment, feeling the sun on the peak on my face. And\\nmy arms around my uncle as I sit behind him on the horse.\\nI step out of the car, barely regis tering the cameras and the chatter from\\nthe reporters as I blindly follow Mirai up the steps of the church. People are\\ntalking to me, taking my hand and giving it a little hug with both of theirs,\\nbut I can’ t think.\\nI don’ t feel good.\\nWhy did I come  back? I thought I needed to do this. Be here. It’s only\\nright, right?\\nI swallow the sickness rising up my throat.\\nPeople crowd us, all hungry for something, and even though I couldn’ t\\nstomach openin g up my social media when I got into town, it’s clear my\\nparents’ suicide is still top news.\\nHell, some director is proba bly already pitching the story to a\\nproduction company , so my parents’ death can be lamented in some TV\\nmovie where they’ll be portrayed as perfect and in love from the moment\\nthey met. And me, their loving daughter—the produc t of their\\nShakespearean tragedy—will only be a significant character at the end… as\\nI stand at their headstone and smile that they’re finally safely together for\\nall eternity .\\nI take a seat in the front pew with Mirai, the only good part of all this is\\nno one expects much from the grieving daughter , so I can sit quietly without\\nlooking weird for once.\\nI close my eyes behind my glasses again. Two days ago, I was making\\ntoys for the horses—milk jugs stuck with carrots and apples they could play\\nwith to get their treats. Were the jugs empty by now? Kaleb doesn’ t care,\\nand Noah probably wouldn’ t notice.\\nI don’t know when the funeral begins, but when Mirai nudges me and\\nwhispers in my ear, “Glasses,” to remind me to remove my eyewear , I open\\nmy eyes and see the caskets in front of me.\\nI take off my glasses, folding them gently and slipping them into my\\npocket.\\nThe speakers go up, one by one over the next hour, telling stories I’d\\nnever heard and painting a picture of people I didn’ t know . I sit there,\\nlistening to Mirai talk about what a pleasure it was to be a part of their lives\\nand support their work, while Cassidy (no double e) and Mr. Palmer tell stories of their youth and early careers, their charitable work a large part of\\nthe narrative the publicist probably asked them to push to remind people\\nthat how they left this world wasn’ t the most important thing.\\nAs Delmont, my father ’s closes t friend, stands up there and talks about\\ntheir college football days and summers backpacking in Turkey or Chile or\\nwherever , Mirai puts her hand on mine to alert me it’ s almost time.\\nMy stomach churns. I could talk about their work, I guess. How they\\nwere an inspiration to me, and I could lie about all the cards and presents\\nthey surprised me with at schoo l, even though it was Mirai, and I always\\nknew it was her , even though she gave them the credit.\\nI could talk about what I’ve learned from my uncle and cousi ns. And\\nthen say I learned it from my parents instead.\\nI don’t want to be quiet anym ore. I want to prove to them that they\\ndidn’ t break me. That I won’ t let them affect my voice and my ability to be\\nbrave.\\nBut as I try to steady my feet under me to get ready to stand up, I can’ t.\\nI don’ t want to lie.\\n“Things change , life moves on, and the world with it,” Delmont says.\\n“But death? Death is as sure as night.”\\nI look up at him, listening to his words.\\n“It’s a part of us all.” He looks  around at the audience as he starts to\\nwrap up his speech. “The only thing we really leave behind is the work that\\nwe do and the people who love us.”\\nThe people who love us…\\n“Amelia and Hannes didn’ t leave anything on the table,” he concludes.\\n“They always knew the answer to the most important question in one’s life\\n—where do I want to be today?”\\nI stare at my parents’ caskets, closed, so we all would rememb er them\\nthe way they were.\\nAnd the tears start falling down my cheeks, now after days.\\nI hate them.\\nI hate them, and I’ve wasted too much time hating them.\\nThis isn’ t where I want to be.\\nYou loved each other . I wipe my tears, looking over at them and the\\nwords I couldn’ t muster before finally coming. You wer e luckier than most.\\nAt least they had each other . You were capable of so much when it came to love. I drop my eyes,\\nstaring at my lap, my fists clenching around my coat. And you consider ed\\nwhat it would be like to live without love, because you decided  not to live\\nwithout each other . Did you consider what it was like for me—all these\\nyears—living without you?\\nTears fall silently , and everythin g is blurry . I close my eyes, all the years\\nof anger rising up as I grit my teeth.\\nI hate your house , I tell them in my head. I hate the stenc h of your\\nperfume and your candles and your hairspray . I hate the feel of your clothes\\nand the white walls, the white carpets, and the white furnitur e. I try to calm\\nmy breathing. The library full of books that have never been opened and\\nhow nothing was ever warm.\\nI hated you.\\nI can’ t catch my breath. The air just feels too thick. I’m cold.\\nI hate how I never told you any of this. How I never fought or said\\nanything or called you out. How I never walked out to look in the world for\\nwhat I needed. How I let you win.\\nHow I never let you know that you devastated me.\\nThat’ s where I wanted to be when they died. Standing.\\nThat’ s all I want.\\nBut I was too much of a cowar d to talk to you, I mouth to myself, my\\ntears now gone as I draw in a deep breath. Cowar ds always live to regret,\\nbecause it’s only too late that they realize the journey is filled with people\\nwho ar e afraid.\\nThey didn’ t have to walk alone.  \\n \\n \\nN o a h\\n \\nThe chainsaw whirs outside, and I sit up in bed, swinging my legs over the\\nside. I run a hand through my hair. Will he fight me if I don’t want to leave\\nthis fucking room today?\\nKaleb ditched us and went hunting again yesterday , and Dad’ s barely\\nsaid three words to me in the last forty-eight hours. Fun, fun. It’s like old\\ntimes again.\\nI shake my head  and stand up, throwing on some jeans before leaving\\nthe room. I’m getting out of this house. Out of this town. In the middle of\\nthe night like a coward, because I can’t handle confrontatio n, but I’m\\nleaving. Maybe he’ll realize how fantastic I was once he doesn’ t have me to\\npush around anymore. Because he certainly won’ t get in Kaleb’ s face.\\nAnd maybe Kaleb will finally utter a word when I’m not here to do all\\nhis talking for him.\\nI can’ t do another winter with them. I’ll go crazy .\\nHeading downstairs, I walk into the kitchen and go straight  for the\\ncoffee machine, seeing my dad step in from the shop. I grab a mug and then\\nthe pot, seeing it’ s empty just as he stops to refill his, too.\\nI sigh, my headache swelling more.\\n“Just…” He shoves his cup and stalks away . “Make another pot.”\\nI cock an eyebrow but do as I’m told. How long has he been up?\\nHe throws a loaf of bread, some  bacon he fried up, and a couple boxes\\nof cereal on the table with the milk and butter , and I dump out the used\\ncoffee filter , replacing it with a clean one. Once the coffee grounds are loaded, I fill up the water container and\\nstart brewing, grabbing an Oreo from the package sitting on the counter .\\nWhat am I doing  today? More of the same, but there’ s always beer. I’ve\\ngot that to look forward to, at least, now that I missed my window for the\\nsponsorship with DeltaCorps.\\nAnd now that the house is fucking silent again, because…\\nHe sits down, making himself a sandwich, and I plop down across from\\nhim, taking a bite of the cookie.\\nBut at the taste, my stomach immediately rolls. I force the bite down but\\ntoss the rest of the cookie onto the table.\\nI feel like shit.\\n“This fuckin’ sucks,” I grumble.\\nI miss her. We all miss her. Even Kaleb, too, I think. He came home\\ntwenty-four hours ago with some waterfowl, found her gone, and left again\\nsoon after , disappearing into the woods again for another whole damn day .\\nI miss coming downstairs and seeing lights on. Girls like it cozy and\\nwarm. I liked that touch she added to the house. And seeing her outside or\\nin the barn or padding around  barefoot in our kitchen… The house felt\\ngood. Even her pissy moods amused me.\\nThe front door opens and Kaleb walks in, tearing off his shirt, bloody\\nfrom whatever he’s stocking our freezer with for the winter . I can almost\\nsee Tiernan holding the back of her hand to her mouth, looking like she was\\nabout to throw up every time she saw him like that.\\nMy heart aches a little.\\n“Just go get her ,” I tell my father , but I don’ t look at him.\\nKaleb fills up a glass with water , and I wait for the argument from my\\ndad, because there’ s no merit in anything I think or say. He never listens,\\njust responds in the exact opposite of whatever I want.\\n“She’ s dealing with the death of her parents,” he says, swallowing his\\nfood. “She’ s an adult. I can’ t tell her what to do.”\\n“She’ s not an adult,” I retort. “Her place is here. It’ s your say . Not hers.”\\nHe sits back in his chair , dropping his sandwich to his plate. I know\\nwhat he’s thinking. I sound fucking crazy . Would I really want him to drag\\nher back here kicking and screaming?\\nNo.\\nMaybe. “The funeral was only yesterday ,” he tells me. “She might still come\\nback.”\\nYeah, right. We fought with her like assholes, and she took no time to\\ndecide to leave. Why would she come back? I wouldn’ t.\\nI reach over and pick up the juice, uncapping the container and lifting it\\nto my mouth.\\nBut then a door slams upstairs, and I hear a creak of the floorboards.\\nI freeze, locking eyes with my dad.\\nHis eyes narrow .\\n“Did you have someone over last night?” he asks me.\\n“No.”\\nI lower the juice, both of us training our ears.\\nMaybe Kaleb had someone…\\nBut before I can finish the thought, we hear footfalls on the stairs and all\\nturn our heads, seeing Tiernan swing around the bannister , dressed in baggy\\njean shorts, my T-shirt, hair a mess, and sunglasses shielding her from the\\nmorning light as she hugs herself against the chill in the air .\\nWhat the fuck?\\n“Morning,” she says through a yawn.\\nI shoot up out of my chair , gaping at her as she brushes past the table to\\nthe cof fee machine.\\n“Morning?” I burst out. “Where did you come from?”\\nShe just strolls in, like she never left. Is this a dream?\\n“When did you get in?” my dad asks before she can answer me.\\nShe pushes her sunglasses back on her head, yawning again. Kaleb\\nstares down at her as she stands next to him, pouring a cup of cof fee.\\n“Last night,” she replies.\\n“How did you get here from the airport?”\\n“Uber ,” she tells him.\\n“You came back,” I say , still stunned as my heart pounds.\\nShe’s really here? Like she was in her room this whole fucking time I\\nwas pouting down here?\\nShe turns her head over her shoulder , looking at both of us like we’re\\nidiots.\\nShe definitely won’ t handle a hug right now .\\n“Can someone look at the shift on the tractor?” she asks, changing the\\nsubject. “It’s sticking. And the vacuum? It’s way, way too loud.” She pours a little cream in her coffee and stirs. “Just because y’all build motorcycles\\ndoes not mean everything on this property needs to be rewired to sound like\\na muscle car .”\\nShe picks up her cup and starts to walk out of the room.\\n“I’ll handle Bernadette, feed the horses and dogs, and pick all the\\ntomatoes before  I get started on breakfast,” she tells us. “Would someone\\nmind bringing a load of wood up to my room sometime today? It’s getting\\ntoo cold at night.”\\nShe leaves the room, heading back upstairs, and I stare at my dad, my\\nmouth hanging open a little.\\n“I’m not feeding you until the stalls are done and Shawnee’ s had her\\nwork-out!” she yells as she climbs the stairs. “Let’ s go!”\\nMy dad’s eyes go wide and he pops out of his chair , stuffing the last\\npiece of bacon in his mouth as I laugh, downing a huge gulp of orange juice\\nbefore rushing out of the kitchen.\\nYes, ma’am.\\n \\n \\nI finish putting a blanket over the mare and run my hand down her head,\\nbetween the eyes before closing the gate and scurrying out of the barn.\\nI shiver. Shit, it got chilly . The sun dipped behind the peak an hour ago,\\nand while it’s not quite dark, I’m missing its warmth. Grabbing my\\nsweatshirt draped over the logs, I pull it over my head, fixing my hat again.\\n“Tiernan!” I shout, watching her step out of the greenhouse and yank\\nthe hose back over to the side. “Let’ s get drunk!”\\nShe flashes me a small smile, and I inhale, smelling the steaks on the\\ngrill.\\nShe jogs up the steps of the house, her rain boots covered in dried mud\\nfrom the last time she wore them, and I run after her, both of us heading\\naround the deck to the back of the house.\\nI grab two beers out of the tub, swiping off the ice and untwisting the\\ntops. I hand one to her as we stop next to my dad.\\n“It’s chilly .” She bounces up and down.\\nI pull off my sweatshirt and hand it to her. She’s already wearing  my old\\nblue and white flannel, but she doesn’ t argue. Taking the navy-colored\\npullover , she slips it on and takes the extra beer I of fer. “Never too cold to grill,” my dad points out.\\nShe smiles. “It smells good. I’m starving.”\\nHe loads the steaks on a plate, I take the grilled corn, and Tiernan runs\\ninside to grab the macaroni salad and potato chips.\\nWe set everything down on the picnic table in the shop, the doors open,\\nand the music playing as the evening air grows crisper . The beer lulls my\\nveins, and I polish off the bottle as I reach behind me and grab the bottle of\\nPatrón of f the worktable.\\nI pour us each a shot, handing one to T iernan.\\n“Uh, no,” she says, setting the condiments on the table.\\n“Yes.” I nod, placing it next to her plate. “W e’re getting fucked up.”\\nKaleb walks over, taking a seat, and I throw back my shot, blowing a\\nbreath at the burn. I slam the glass down and let out a yelp as it hits my\\nstomach, leapin g around the table, scooping Tiernan up, and flipping her\\nover my shoulder .\\n“Because she’ s ours all winter!” I spin around, hearing her squeal.\\n“Noah!” she barks.\\nBut I laugh anyw ay. Thank fuck this day is ending better than it started.\\nI might’ve actually had to stand up for myself and walk out of here for\\ngood.\\nHaving her around will make this house bearable. She makes my dad\\nbearable.\\n“For Christ’ s sake, sit down,” Dad orders. “Eat like a family .”\\nI put her back on her feet, chuckling and pushing her down in her chair .\\nPopping another beer, I watch as her eyes lock in on the tequila  and she\\ncocks an eyebrow .\\nCome on. My father never drinks enough to get drunk, and Kaleb could\\ndrink my weight in Jack, Jim, and Jose together and still not feel anything.\\nShe takes a deep breath and picks up the glass as my dad doles out the\\nsteak, and she tips it back, swallowing the entire shot in one gulp.\\nAnd without training wheels. Good girl.\\nI refill my glass and then hers.\\n“Stop.” She holds out her hand. “I don’ t need to be puking.”\\n“Tell you what,” I say as she scoops out salad onto our plates. “I’ll make\\nyou a bet. If I clean my plate of all my food before you, you have to do two\\nmore shots.”\\nShe looks at the T -bone on her plate that’ s bigger than her face. “And if I clean mine first?” she asks.\\n“Then I’ll do the two shots.”\\n“You were going to do the two shots anyway .”\\nI snort. Y es, true.\\n“I’ll do your laundry this week,” I of fer.\\n“No one else touches my underwear , thank you.”\\n“Yeah, that’ s clear as day .”\\nHer eyes bug out, and my father breaks into a quiet laugh, he and her\\nsharing a quick glance right before he shuts up.\\nShe purses her lips and glares at me.\\n“Okay , okay ,” I say, getting serio us. “If you clean your plate first, I have\\nbreakfast duty for the rest of the week.”\\nShe ponders it for a moment and then nods once. “Deal.”\\nI pick up my steak knife and fork, seeing we both have the same cut of\\nmeat and the same scoop of macaroni salad.\\nHer hands remain in her lap.\\n“Ready?” she asks.\\n“You don’ t need utensils?”\\nShe shakes her head, an unsettling smirk on her face. “Nope.”\\nOkayyy . You’re so doing these two shots.\\n“Go!” I yell.\\nI shovel in a mouthful and look over, seeing her take her plate and set it\\non the ground.\\nHuh?\\nI freeze,  watchin g Danny and Johnny scarf up everything on her plate,\\none taking the steak and the other tearing off half as they both escape to a\\ncorner to savor their spoils.\\nWhat the fuck?\\n“That wasn’ t the deal!” I blurt out, food nearly falling out of my mouth.\\n“You said I had to clean my plate.”\\n“You!” I reiterate. “YOU had to clean the plate!”\\n“Semantics.” She takes a swig of her beer, a look of self-satisfaction on\\nher face.\\n“That was your dinner , honey ,” Dad warns her .\\nShe shrugs. “Saving calories for breakfast in the morning.” And then\\nshe looks at me. “Pancakes, please. W ith sausage and toast.”\\nShe laughs, and I growl under my breath. At least I can still do her two shots.\\nWe sit and eat, Tiernan picking a sweet pickle out of the little bowl and\\nbiting into it.\\n“Snow’ s coming soon,” Dad tells us, lifting his beer as he looks at\\nTiernan. “We’ll hit town a couple more times, maybe get you some low-key\\nattire of your own that fits.”\\n“She can wear my shit.” I chew my food. “I got plenty .”\\n“She’ s drowning in it.” And then he looks at her again. “We’ll find\\nsome jeans that fit that don’ t cost three-hundred dollars.”\\n“Three. Hundre d. Dollars.” I arch a brow at her. “What the hell\\npossesses you?”\\nShe scow ls and opens her mouth  to snap back at me but then she stops,\\npausing as she notices Kaleb putting a new plate in front of her and\\nscraping of f half his steak, already cut up into bite-sized chunks.\\nHe doesn’ t make eye contact and goes back to eating and drinking as if\\nnothing happened.\\n“Uh…” She searches for her words. “Th—thank you.”\\nI roll my eyes and take a drink of my beer . I should’ve thought of that.\\nIt takes her a minute to remember where we were, but then she glares at\\nme again. “First of all,” she says, “my family’ s personal shopper buys my\\nclothes—or bought my clothes—and second of all…they look good.”\\n“You don’t need to look good, ” my father interjects. “Looking good\\naround here ends you up married and pregnant at eighteen.”\\n“Your sons definitely know what a condom is and so do I.”\\nI snort.\\n“Besides,” she adds, “I haven’ t had a single boyfriend. When I’ve had\\nthree then you can worry about me ending up pregnant and married.”\\n“Three?” I mumble over my food.\\nShe hesitates, looking like she’d rather not explain herself. “My mother\\nsaid no woman should get married until they’ve had at least three…”\\nShe waves her hand as if I know how to finish that sentence.\\n“Three…?” my father prompts her .\\n“Lovers,” she blurts out. “Boyfriends, whatever .”\\nI pinch my eyebrows together . “What the hell are you talking about?”\\nShe lets out a sigh, straight ening her spine and looking visibly\\nuncomfortable. Finally , she takes the ketchup, Heinz sauce, and A.1. bottle,\\nmoving them one next to the other . “Lust, learn, and love,” she says, placing the condiments and touching\\nher finger to the ketchup. “My mother said the first boy—or man—is a\\ncrush. You think  you love them, but what you really love is how they make\\nyou feel. It’s not love. It’s lust. Lust for attention. Lust for danger . Lust to\\nfeel special.” She looks betwe en us. “You’re needy with number one.\\nNeedy for someone to love you.”\\nMy father for gets the food he’ s chewing as he gapes at her .\\n“The second is to learn about yourself.” She touches the Heinz. “Your\\nfirst crush has been crushed. You’re sad, but most of all, you’re angry .\\nAngry enough to not let it happen again,” she explains. “To not give\\nyourself over so much this time. To not give up your power to be his booty\\ncall at midnight and there waiting whenever he decides to show up.”\\nShe’s describing us, I take it.\\n“Number two is where you finally learn what you’re capable of,” she\\ncontinues, tucking a loose strand from her ponytail behind her ear. “You\\nstart getting demanding. You grow bold, not afraid to start calling some\\nshots. You’re also not afraid to be greedier in the bedroom, because it’s\\nabout what you want and not what he wants. Number two is to be used. In a\\nway.”\\nMy dad clears his throat, and I laugh to myself as I drop my fork and\\ngive her my full attention. She said bedroom.\\n“What the fuck did she teach you?” he mumbles.\\nBut I want her to keep going. “And number three?” I ask, pickin g up the\\nA.1.\\n“Love.” She snatches the bottle away . “When the lessons of your\\nweakness with number one and your selfishness with number two sink in,\\nand you find a medium. When you know who you are and you’re ready to\\nwelcome everyt hing he is, and you’re not afraid anymore.” She puts the\\nbottle back in its place. “You still might not have a happy ending, but you’ll\\nengage in a healthy relationship and handle yourself in a way you’re proud\\nof.”\\n“And you think your mother is the one to listen to?” Dad replies.\\n“She was a failure as a mother ,” Tiernan points out. “But nothing else.\\nIt’s the only advice she ever gave me, actually , so I kind of hang on to it.”\\nIt actual ly isn’t terrible advice. I’m so glad I didn’ t marry my first. Or\\nmy fifth. People learn about themselves through sex. It’s true. And\\nsometimes it may take a lot of living to become the person you want to be. I’m happy my future wife won’ t have to experience the complete prick I\\nwas at seventeen. I was much worse. Like a lot worse.\\n“Well, sounds like you already know what you need to know ,” my dad\\ntells her . “Why go through three men to get it?”\\n“Some lessons can’t be taught,” she says, taking a bite of the steak\\nKaleb gave her . “Just learned. Don’ t you think?”\\nI watch in amus ement as he can’t fucking respond, because she’s right.\\nSometimes people have to make their own mistakes and feel the pain.\\nShe takes her empty beer and stands up. “Anyway , nothing to worry\\nabout,” she assures him. “I have zero interest in relationship drama, and\\neven if I did, we’ll be deep in snow for months very soon. The perfect\\nchastity belt.”\\nShe walks over to the garbage,  tossing her empty bottle and reaching\\ninto the fridge to grab another .\\nOur eyes follow her, barely breathing as we watch her lean over in her\\nthree-hundred-dollar jeans to find a new bottle.\\nI shift in my seat, the sudden bulge between my legs swelling.\\n“Yeah,” I murmur sarcastically as I lift my bottle to my lips. “Because\\nthere’ s no danger here whatsoever .”\\nDad shoots me a look.\\nPretty sure he knows by now that it’ s going to be a long fucking winter .  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\n“What’ s this?” I dart my eyes up to Noah before taking the bag he’s\\nhanding me.\\nWe’ve been running to town every chance we get over the past few\\nweeks, anticipating the end of our cheesebur ger and milkshake runs. I also\\nneeded to hit the pharmacy today to stock up on everything under the sun\\nthat can remedy  what might hit me up on the peak this winter , when I won’ t\\nbe able to go to town for what ails me. I’m prepared for head aches, sinus\\nissues, joint pain, back pain, cramps, allergies—not that I currently have\\nthose, but you never know—and I’m about to be all stocked up on my birth\\ncontrol.\\nI debated going of f, but… I guess it’ s just best to stay on my routine.\\nHe shrugs. “I’ve never gotten a girl a birthday present,” he says as I\\npeer into the bag. “If you don’ t like it, you don’ t have to wear it.”\\nI reach in, pulling out a T-shirt and baseball cap. We stand in the corner\\nof the store, waiting for my scrip t to be filled, and I set the bag on the floor ,\\nfanning out the shirt.\\nIt’s light blue with the town’ s emblem on the breast, and I turn it over,\\nseeing the same Van der Berg Extreme logo covering the whole back. It’s\\njust like Noah’ s, only his is white.\\nI grin. “Is this your way of telling me you want your clothes back?”\\n“Just thought you might like something that fits you a little bet—” He\\npauses, rethinking. “Actually , my clothes look pretty good on you. I just\\nthought you’d like something new is all.” Yeah. I love it. I don’t have many T-shirts of my own. Just school ones,\\nand those don’ t have good memories, so this one will be fun to wear .\\nI look at the burgundy-colored  cap with the word WILD written in\\ncursive.\\n“It was either that or DIV A,” he says.\\nI laugh and pull it onto my head, peering at him under the bill. “I am a\\nDIVA,” I allow . “But I’d rather be a wild diva.”\\nI reach in, wrapping one arm around his neck for a quick hug.\\n“Thanks.”\\nI pull away , but his arm is around my waist, holding me to him for a real\\nhug. I falter , taken back.\\nBut then, I tighten my embrace.\\nIt feels good—hugging someone who doesn’ t want to pull away first.\\n“My mom calls me sometimes,” he says, his voice low and pained. “My\\ndad doesn’ t know .”\\nI back up, releasing him, so I can look in his eyes.\\n“Not sure why I’m telling you.” His voice is quiet. “She wants money in\\nher commissary account.”\\nI watch him, listening. No one talks about her. I don’t even know why\\nshe’s in jail.\\n“And I put the money in her account, because I let myself enjoy  the idea\\nfor a moment that she needs me.” He gives me a sad smile, looking so\\nsolemn. So serious. Not Noah . “Even though I know I’m just the first\\nperson she assumes she can take advantage of. She knows my dad won’ t\\ntalk to her . That Kaleb can’ t talk to her .”\\nNoah can’ t talk to Jake. I gathered that much in my first week here.\\nHe doesn’ t have anyone in that house to really connect to. I never really\\nsaw that before.\\n“I wish she was dead.” Noah stares at the floor but then looks up at me.\\n“I wish she was dead, because then I could love her .”\\nI stare at him, and he stares at me, both of us barely breathing but calm.\\nHe steps  closer . “Would you rather be used than never thoug ht of at\\nall?”\\n“Would you rather be never thought of at all or used?” I throw back.\\nEven now, I’m not sure. At least his mother knows he exists and can put\\non a show of love, even if it’ s fake. But then…at least my parents didn’t lie to me. They didn’ t toy with me\\nor jerk me around. I always knew where I stood.\\nWho had it worse? Him or me?\\n“Try the shirt on before we leave,” Noah says.\\nI blink at the sudden change in subject.\\nHe steps closer , a hardness in his eyes that wasn’ t there a moment ago\\nas he backs me up farther into the corner .\\n“I don’ t want it too tight,” he explains.\\nHe hovers, his body an inch from mine as he looks down at me.\\nWhat? Here? My eyes flash to the store around us.\\n“Noah…”\\n“I’m really glad you’re here,” he whispers, cutting me off. “I’m glad\\nyou came back.”\\n“Why do you want me here so much?”\\n“Why not?”\\nI study his eyes. “Because when you leave, I won’ t be where ver you\\ngo.”\\nHe falls silent, but his gaze doesn’t leave mine. He wants to leave here\\nso badly , and he will. Eventually .\\nEventually , I’ll leave, too. He doesn’ t need me. He needs a life raft.\\nLooking around  and not seeing anyone around us, I shield  myself\\nbetween him and the corner as I pull off his old T-shirt I’m wearing and\\nhand it to him.\\nRefitting my cap, I slip my arms through the new one, his eyes on me\\nmaking my skin tingle as I avoid his gaze.\\nMy bra covers more than a bikini, and I’m still in my jeans. Overall, I’m\\nmuch more dressed than I was at the lake all those weeks ago when they\\ntook me fishing.\\nBut with my hair hanging in two scraggly braids, a baseball hat, and dirt\\nunder my fingernails for the first time in my life, I’ve never felt this pretty .\\nHow he looks at me…\\nHow Jake looks at me…\\nHow Kaleb refuses to look at me, but I know he’s aware of my every\\nmove when we’re in the same room.\\nThe skin of my breasts, only half covered in my hot pink bra, burns with\\nfire unde r Noah’ s gaze, and I pull the shirt on over my head, feeling Noah’ s\\nhands brush my arms as he reaches up to help pull it down over my body . I fix my hat again, his fingers still gripping the hem below my hips.\\nI’m afraid to meet his eyes but I can feel the heat rolling of f him.\\n“The local guys don’t talk to you,” he orders in a raspy voice. “They\\ndon’t touch you tonight. Do you understand?”\\nI nod, still not meeting his gaze. My heart pumps so hard it hurts, but\\nmy stomach is flipping like I’m riding a roller coaster .\\nHe finally releases me and backs up. “It looks nice.”\\nWhat does?\\nOh, the shirt. Right.\\n“Tiernan,” someone calls.\\nAnd I dart past him to get my prescription, anything to get away .\\n \\n \\nHours later, I’m twirling in my room, smiling as my new summe r dress fans\\nout along with my hair. It’s too cold to wear this tonight, but I’m going to\\nanyway . After seeing it on sale in a shop earlier , I got an itch to clean under\\nmy fingernails and put on some make-up for my birthday dinner , since this\\ncould very well be the last time we hit town. A storm is coming.\\nU2’s “Dancing Barefoot”  plays, and I move, closing my eyes and\\nrunning my hands up under my hair. My homework is desperately late, I\\nhave missed calls—probably birthday wishes from Mirai and friends of my\\nparents—and my shipment of paperbacks to get me through the winter is\\ndelayed in Denver , but… I delet ed all my social media and I’m now a legal\\nadult, completel y in charge of where I can go and what I can do, so any\\nweight on my shoulders feels a lot lighter now. I’m actually excited, even\\nthough the guys are busy dreading the boring coming months.\\nI spin and spin, but then I spot a figure out of the corner of my eye and\\nstumble to a stop, seeing Kaleb  standing in the hallway . He looks like he\\njust came down  from his room, paused in the middle of pullin g on his T-\\nshirt as he watches me.\\nMy pulse quickens. It’s unsettl ing to have his attention, because I’m\\nnever sure what he’ s thinking, but I always feel like it’ s not good.\\nStalking over, I kick the door shut, smiling to myself as I pick up my\\nheels and sit on the bed, sliding my feet in. I feel great, and I’m not letting\\nhim ruin my night. Carter , my parents’ security , is taking care of the house\\nback in L.A., Mirai and our lawyer are handling all of my parents’ estate business, and for the first time in my life I get to be a kid tonight. Smiling,\\nlaughing, playin g, being around people who care about me… It seems\\nweird that I finally get that on the day I become an adult, but I won’ t\\nanalyze it. I’m taking it.\\nBuckling up my Louboutins, a Christmas gift from my parents last year\\n—courtesy of Mirai, of course—set with pretty crystals and five-inch heels,\\nI grab a cream-colored shawl to go over my dark pink dress and head out of\\nthe room.\\nKaleb is long gone, and I carry the shawl as I fluff up my loose curls\\nand smooth out my dress. It’s simple and innocent, but totally not me.\\nBackless and short—falling mid-thigh—it has a deep cleavage and\\nspaghetti straps. My heels clack on the wooden stairs, and I walk through\\nthe living room, seeing the guys around the table as I set my shawl and\\nphone down and go for my purse.\\nDigging out my license and cash, I turn and hand it to my uncle. “W ould\\nyou hold this in your wallet?” I ask. “It saves me from carrying a bag.”\\nBut he just looks at me, kind of scowling.\\n“What?” I say .\\n“You’re overdressed.”\\nI tsk, giving him a coy smile as I stuff my card and money in his hand.\\n“There’ s no such thing.”\\nOf course, compared to them I am overdressed. They’re all in jeans,\\nNoah double-fisting Budweisers.\\n“People don’ t dress like that here,” Jake points out.\\nAnd he really didn’ t need to say that. It’ s not like I haven’ t noticed.\\n“I don’ t fit in anywhere,” I tell him. “I’m used to it.”\\nSeriously . I feel good. Stop hyperventilating.\\nHe cocks an eyebrow and turns away , and I can see Noah’ s concerned\\ngaze flash to his.\\nJake finally shoves a large pack age over to me, exquisitely wrapped in\\nsilver paper with a big silver bow .\\nI reach for it. “What’ s this?”\\nIt’s a weird shape.\\nBut all he says is, “Open it.”\\nThe paper looks just as pretty as everything under my Christmas trees\\ngrowing up, and I can’t help but feel the smile I’m wearing.  I know he knows what’ s inside. Which means he picked it out. Hell, he might’ve even\\nwrapped it, too.\\nI rip the paper , tearing it off in large sheets and picking at the scraps\\nuntil the whole thing comes into view , and I look at the compound bow with\\na pink camouflage pattern and six arrows.\\nI pick it up. “W ow.”\\n“Do you know how to shoot it?” my uncle asks.\\n“A little.” I fist the grip and draw the band back, aiming toward the\\nfridge. “I haven’ t used one in a long time.”\\nAnd I’ve never used a compound bow . They didn’ t have these at camp.\\n“Noah set up a target in the barn,” he tells me. “You can practice before\\nwe take it out hunting.”\\nI drop my arms and look at him. “Hunting?”\\nThey all stand silent, and I gaze around at them as if there was a\\nstipulation in my contract for living here that I missed.\\n“I don’t think I want to do that.” I set the bow down on the table. I’ll\\ncook the meat. I’m not supplying it, though.\\nBut Noah just laughs, and Jake shakes his head.\\n“We’ll talk about it,” he says.\\nJust as long as it’ s not today .\\n“Well, thank you.” I give him a peck on the cheek. “I really love it.”\\nHe nods once but won’ t meet my eyes. He clears his throat. “I’ll go\\nwarm up the truck.”\\nI grab my wrap and swing it around my shoulders. An Aran Islands\\nsweater from Mirai to keep me warm this winter , a shirt and hat to help me\\nblend in with the locals, and a new toy . Better than any birthday so far .\\nBut as I move to follow Jake, Kaleb steps in front of me, stopping me.\\nI look up.\\nHe pauses a moment before he reaches into his back pocket and pulls\\nout a long strap of dark brown leather .\\nI narrow my eyes as he of fers it to me.\\nThe horn outside honks, but we stay , Noah approaching my side.\\n“What’ s this?” I reach out and take it, threading it through my hand and\\nturning it over .\\n“He makes them,” Noah says.\\nIt’s a belt. Dark and tanned with carvings in the leather and an antique-\\nlooking silver buckle. I study the etchings. There are trees, a waterfall, the peak—the view from my bedroom window , actually—something that looks\\nlike a braid of hair , a horse, and a dreamcatcher .\\nI swallow . Why would he put a dreamcatcher on there?\\nBut it is beautiful. He made this himself?\\nThen I notice something else, and I chuckle.\\n“The notches go all the way to the buckle,” I point out. “I’m flattered,\\nbut my waist isn’ t that small.”\\nNoah leans in, whispering, “But your wrists are.”\\nMy heart skips, and I dart my eyes up to Kaleb as he stares down at me.\\nWhat?\\nBut Noah just laughs, both of them leaving me there as they head\\noutside.\\nAnd I don’t realize I’m staring back down at the belt, spacing off until\\nJake honks again, making me jump.\\n \\n \\n“Give it to me!” I shout as Noah holds my phone out of my reach. “Come\\non.”\\nHe plants his hand on my forehead and pushes me back as we sit at the\\ntable and he inspects the photo. “Holy shit,” he says loud enough for\\neveryone around us to hear . “Why do you hide this?”\\nI launch up and snatch the phon e out of his hand, plopping back down\\nin my seat. “Because it’ s a dumb picture.”\\n“Then why do you keep it on your phone?”\\n“Because,” I tell him. “It’ s the only thing I’ve done that I’m proud of.”\\nI go to exit out of the link to the one article about me ever written, along\\nwith the photo shoot the magazine insisted be done to accompany it, but\\nJake plucks my cell out of my hands instead, taking his turn to look at the\\npic.\\nI glare, opening my big mouth to protest, but I decide against it, casting\\na worried glance around at the other families trying to have a peaceful meal\\nin the steak house.\\nIt was my fault, showing it to Noah in the first place. Last spring, Vanity\\nFair did an exposé on the children of the stars and featured me in their\\n“collection.” Unfortunately , a photo shoot came with the territory , one shot\\nin particular of me in my French braids, a sports bra, and some lacrosse gear. I looked sweaty and dirty but kinda sexy, and even thoug h the entire\\nthing was a lie concocted by my parents’ publicists to make me look and\\nsound incredible, I really liked the experience. Even though I’d never\\nplayed lacrosse in my life.\\nIt was the one time I felt lar ge.\\nYes, the article was bullshit about how involved I was in school.\\nNothing was true in regard to my activism and hobbies, and I only got the\\nfeature because of my parents. I hated the idea when they made me do it.\\nThe photo shoot , though… I felt pretty . Even if I felt stupid after it was\\nover.\\n“It’s a great picture. W e’ll put it up on the website,” Noah tells his father\\nand then lifts his arms, knife and fork in hand as he recites the words on an\\nimaginary header . “The New Addition to V an der Ber g Extreme.”\\nI roll my eyes, turning my attention to Jake. “Give it to me.”\\nHe passes it to Kaleb who takes it and barely glances at it before\\nhanding it to Noah.\\n“Now ,” I grit through my teeth, trying to keep our banter down. I only\\nmeant to brag about how I’ve worn less in public than I am tonight when\\nJake got snippy about my backless dress again at dinner . I didn’ t want them\\ngawking at me in my bra, though. In public.\\nGlasses and silverware clank in the rustic old restaurant, and the smell\\nof barbecue sauce and French fries fills the air, making my nose sting from\\ntime to time.\\nThe steak was overcooked, the Coke is watered down, and the floor is\\nso greasy , I can spell my name on it with the heel of my shoe.\\nBut I wouldn’ t have anything different for my eighteenth birthday . I’ve\\nhad more fun already tonight than I did in all my past birthdays combined.\\nNoah hands the phone back to me, and I take it, turning it off and\\nsticking it under my thigh, so they can’ t get it again.\\n“So, what do you say?” he asks. “Wanna look sexy like that on our\\nwebsite?”\\n“Shut up.”\\nI tuck my chair back in and take a sip of my soda.\\n“It’s a really good idea,” Noah argues, turning to his father . “That’ s\\nwhat we’re missing in our marketing. Something pretty .”\\n“Noah, Jesus…” Jake shifts uncomfortably in his chair and lifts his\\nbottle to his lips. “No, seriously ,” he continues. “Look at all the other sites. All the shows\\nand expo s we go to. What do they all have in common? Hot girls. We could\\nget a photographer up at the house and do a photo shoot of her on the bikes.\\nIt’ll be great.”\\n“It’ll be snowing by morning,” Jake says. “No photographers are getting\\nup the mountain.” He shoots his eyes to me. “And no one’ s getting down.”\\nI pause, a shiver almost running  through me as I hold my uncle’ s eyes.\\nI’m not sure if I see a warning or a challenge there in regard to the months\\nahead, but I raise my glass in a cheers, ready for whatever .\\nJake grins, raising his beer and Noah follows, all of us clanking our\\nglass together . Kaleb eats his meal.\\n“Besides,” Jake adds, setting his beer down, “we may never see her\\nagain after the spring anyway . Not sure we want to add her to the letterhead\\nquite yet.”\\nI shake my head, knowing he wouldn’ t mind if I stayed forever and\\nwould love the assurance right now that I will.\\nI love being wanted.\\nBut college looms. I’ll need to make decisions soon.\\nNoah looks at me. “Y ou won’ t leave us, will you?”\\nI laugh, unsure how to answer that.\\nInstead, I just tip my chin at my uncle. “May I have a non-vir gin beer\\nfor my birthday?”\\nHe knows full well I’m taking advantage of the allowance in this state\\nthat anyone under twenty-one can drink on private property , as long as\\nthey’re under parental supervision.\\nSo let’ s go home to private property , so I can do that.\\nBut Jake has dif ferent plans.\\n“Let’ s go into the bar ,” he says.\\nMy eyes widen. And I’m out of my chair before any of them.\\nNoah, Kaleb, and I head out of the restaurant while Jake pays the bill,\\nand Noah takes  my hand as we trail down a long hallway , entering the\\nnoise-ridden saloon that’s connected to the restaurant. Country music plays\\non the juke-box, and I crunch peanut shells under my shoes as we walk\\nunder the dim lights and past the pool tables and bar stools.\\nEyes immediate ly turn in our direction as people huddle in small groups\\nand the music blares. I suddenly feel overdressed like Jake suggested. A few interested  pairs of eyes floated up and down my attire as we sat\\ndown in the restaurant earlier , because I haven’ t met many people in town,\\nand they probab ly wondered who I was, but now… my skin warms under\\ntheir gazes, and I clutch Noah’ s hand, a little uncomfortable. The place is\\nfilled with T-shirts, jeans, and beards, and who’ s the moron coming in here\\ndressed for a cocktail party in Malibu?\\nI meet several pairs of eyes as we pass tables of people drinking and\\nsmoking.\\nKaleb tosses some money on the bar and gestures to all of us at the\\nbartender , but the guy cocks his head, eyeing me with suspicion.\\n“It’s okay , Mike,” I hear my uncle suddenly say behind me.\\nI turn around, seeing him give the guy a smile, and that seems to do it,\\nbecause the bartender nods and reaches down to pull four Buds out of the\\ncooler , popping the tops for all of us.\\n“Let’ s go.” Noah nudges my arm.\\nI follow them all—except for Kaleb, because he disappeared once he\\ngot his beer—over to the foosb all table, and Noah and I pair up against\\nJake. I ignore the eyes I feel on my back and take a sip of my beer before\\nsetting it down on the table with Noah’ s and Jake’ s.\\n“They played this on The Karate Kid , right?”\\nJake’ s eyes light up. “V ery good.”\\nI almost laugh at his delighted expression. Seems there’ s still hope for\\nme yet.\\nWe play a few games, Jake winning every time despite being by\\nhimself, and I have to pull my hair over my shoulder to get it off my back\\nby the time we finish the third game, because I’m starting to sweat.\\nThe music in here isn’t my style  usually , but the crowd feeds off it, loud\\nand happy , and I barely even notice the cold gusts of wind that rush through\\nthe front door every time someone arrives or leaves. Some old-timer walks\\nthrough, dusting snow of f his hat, but nothing disturbs the good time.\\n“I’m gonna grab another one,” Jake tells us after the last game,\\ngesturing to his beer .\\nI pick up mine still sitting on the table, untouched, and look around the\\nroom as he walks of f.\\nSome racers sit off to the back, and I recognize a few of the guys and\\ngirls from the group at my uncle’ s house a couple times, and I spot a\\nwoman in a cheap little veil surrounded by others at the bar, all of them throwing back shots. Her tight, black T-shirt reads “Marissa’ s Last Stand”\\nin blingy jewels that sparkle in the dim light.\\nThe song on the jukebox ends,  and a few couples nestled on a small\\npatch of floor who are dancing let go of each other and make their way back\\nto their tables.\\n“Wanna play some pool?” Noah shouts over the noise.\\nI stare at the jukebox, bringing the bottle to my lips. “I want  to play\\nsome music,” I tell him and flash him an apologetic smile as I hold out my\\nhand for money . “Please?”\\nHe rolls his eyes but reaches into his pocket and digs out some ones for\\nme. Jake has my money . Noah knows I’m good for it.\\nHe hands me a couple bills, and I snatch them up. “Thank you.”\\nStrolling of f, I head for the music.\\nJake stands at the bar, talking to some guy, and I still haven’ t seen Kaleb\\nsince we got in here. I stop at the jukebox and look around for him. Kaleb\\nhas barely spared me a glance since he gave me the belt earlier tonight, but\\nsomething about his present keeps gnawing at me, and I’m not sure why .\\nHe made it. By hand. For me.\\nHe knew my birthday was coming.\\nI love that each of them put some thought into what I might like, even\\nthough they really didn’ t have to get me anything at all. It was nice opening\\nup a gift I would buy for myself, instead of a lavish present that tries way\\ntoo hard to put a price on impressing someone.\\nKaleb put in hours of work, though. The thought of him in his\\nworkroom in the barn, quietly working, head hung over my belt, out there\\nalone all that time… for me.\\nBut then I shake my head.\\nI’m overanalyzi ng. He probably had that belt already made and laying\\naround. He just grabbed it as he was leaving his room, and it probably does\\nhave some weirdo sexual undertone with all those notches, like Noah said.\\nI scroll the song selections, finally seeing something not country and put\\nin a bill, dialing in the letter and number . “Do You Want to Touch Me\\nThere”  by Joan Jett starts playing, and all of a sudden some cheers go off. I\\nturn my head over my shoulder to see the bachelorette party holding up\\ntheir arms and moving toward me, already dancing.\\nI smile, ready to move out of the way, but they start scream ing the\\nwords, one of them taking my hand and pulling me in with them. I laugh, unsure of what to do.\\nI look around for my uncle or Noah to rescue me, but in a mom ent, I’m\\ntrapped and can’t see anyone. All of us crowd the small area, and I barely\\nhave room to move as everyone jumps, sways, and rocks out, the wooden\\nfloor underneath us taking a beating.\\nOthers close their eyes, and after a few moments, I take a deep breath\\nand do the same, letting the music and people feed me.\\nMy head reels.\\nI’ve always been awkward with other women. Always. I’m either\\nworried they’ll feel they have to hold my hand in social situations or\\naggravated because they do. I hate being an albatross around their necks or\\nbeing treated like an ignorant little sister they need to take under their wing.\\nThis isn’ t like that, though. I just have to dance.\\nI sing along with the song, flip my hair, and move my body to the\\nmusic, laughing with them and feeling the energy buzz on every inch of my\\nskin. If I had to talk to these girls, it would be a challenge, but for now, I\\ncan enjoy the music.\\nLifting up my arms, I bang my head to the lyrics, unashamed of going\\ncrazy , because so is everyone else, and I relax.\\nFinally , I relax.\\nUntil I open my eyes.\\nJake stands paused in the middle of raising his beer to his mouth,\\nwatching me at the bar. His lips are parted slightly , and he looks like he\\nisn’t breathing. My heart drops into my stomach, and I slow for a moment,\\ntaking a mental inventory to make sure he’ s not mad.\\nI’m not dancing with a local boy .\\nI’m not naked.\\nI came with three male relatives, so I’m not unarmed or unprotected.\\nHe’s not angry , I don’ t think. He’ s just… watching me.\\nA flutter hits my stomach.\\nShifting my gaze, I see Noah at the pool table with some buddies, taking\\na shot of something brown, his eyes immediately turning back over to me as\\nif he’s been keeping an eye out the whole time. His gaze is soft, but his lips\\nare tight.\\nA smile tugs at my mouth, but I don’ t let it out.\\nThe bride-to-be wraps an arm around my waist, and I hang my arm over\\nanother woman’ s shoulder , and we sing and dance, but every smile I wear is for someone else. Everything I do I hope Jake sees, and every move I make\\nI hope Noah is watching.\\nI love their attention.\\nAs the song ends, I laugh with the girls, all of us dispersing as a slow\\ntune starts, and I turn around to head to my uncle at the bar .\\nBut as soon as I spin around, someone is there, and I look up to see\\nTerrance Holcomb.\\n“Hey , California,” he says, slipping his hands to my waist.\\nI start to push him away . “Of f.”\\nJake wouldn’ t lie about that clubhouse this guy keeps. I don’t want\\nanything to do with him.\\n“You’ve met my friend?” he asks.\\nHuh?\\nAt that moment, someone comes up behind me, and I turn my head to\\nsee Cici at my back. She holds my hips, too, laying her chin on my\\nshoulder .\\nThey’re friends? How does that work with Kaleb in the picture?\\nI fight their hold, trying not to make a scene, but every time I get loose,\\nthey reclaim their hold again.\\nI look around for Jake or Noah, but we’re surrounded by people all of a\\nsudden. Lots of people.\\nMen.\\nWhat the hell?\\nAll the ladies on the dance floor are gone, now replaced with Holcomb’ s\\nMotocross buddies.\\nRealization dawns. We’re being surrounded by cover , so Jake and Noah\\ncan’t see.\\n“What if I told you that Kaleb did hit me in the cave that day?” Cici\\nsays behind me. “Would you still want to spend the winter locked up on the\\npeak with him?”\\nI pause, stunned. What?\\n“And what if I told you,” Cici continues, tracing the spaghetti strap of\\nmy dress, “that he can’ t wait to make you bleed, too, and he’ s just biding his\\ntime until you have no means of escaping him.”\\nMy mouth goes dry , and my skin crawls. Kaleb…\\nKaleb isn’ t like that. Holcomb shakes his head, smirking. “They warned you about me, didn’ t\\nthey?” he says. “You should’ve been warned about them. They only wanted\\nyou because you’re rich and beautiful. Think of what your money will do\\nfor V an der Ber g Extreme and what your body will do in their beds.”\\nI shake my head. No.\\n“Noah won’ t need a sponsor ,” Holcomb goes on. “He’ll have you. More\\nmoney than the rest of us could ever raise, and he won’ t have to jump\\nthrough hoops to get it, becau se you love him and you’ll let him have\\nanything he wants.”\\n“No.”\\n“None of them have touched you, then?” Cici asks.\\nI clench  my teeth. But the whee ls turn anyway , remembering Kaleb and\\nme on the hood of the car and Jake and me in the kitchen.\\n“You haven’ t felt threatened?” Holcomb presses. “Not once?”\\nIf you had been dancing with a man like that in public, I would’ve taken\\nyou over my knee.\\nI breathe hard and shallow , recalling my uncle’ s threat all those weeks\\nago. Cici probably heard him when he pulled me away and told T errance.\\n“And now you’re eighteen,” Terrance adds. “Perfectly legal in all fifty\\nstates, just in time for the snow .”\\nWords lodge in my throat, and I yank my arms free of them.\\n“They don’t really like you,” Cici tells me. “You’re useful. Just like the\\nrest of us who service them.” She rubs circles on my belly as her head\\nremains on my shoulder . “And when they fuck you pregnant, they’ll control\\nyou—and your bank account—forever .”\\nNo. They’re my home. The peak is my home.\\n“Stay with us,” Holcomb whis pers, getting closer . “Come home with\\nme.”\\nTears pool as they sandwich me, and as Holcomb dips his mouth into\\nmy neck, I start to cry out.\\nNo.\\nBut just then, a hand wraps around my wrist and yanks me free of them.\\nI gasp, stumbling off the dance floor and right into Kaleb as he pulls me\\ninto his body . He brings me in, my forehead meeting his, and I look up at\\nhim through my watery eyes.\\nHe presses his lips hard to my forehead, and I still for a moment.\\nKaleb… Holcomb and Cici’ s words swirl in my head, but as Kaleb’ s warmth\\nwashes over me, everything they said starts to fade away more and more\\nuntil there’ s nothing but him.\\nI exhale, closing my eyes.\\nThey’re not my parents. This is real. They care about me, and they want\\nme here.\\nKaleb draws back, our forehead s meeting again as he looks down into\\nmy eyes, unblinking. Swiping his thumbs under my eyes, he dries my tears.\\nI go to assure him that I’m okay, but before I can, he drops his hands,\\nhis gaze turning  dark, and he shoves me behind him before lunging for\\nHolcomb.\\nGrabbing him by the neck, he throws Terrance into the jukebox,\\nknocking into other people on the dance floor in the process.\\nI wince, watching the guy hit the machine, the glass case cracking.\\nAll hell breaks loose. Motocross  guys go after Kaleb, a bottle crashes to\\nthe floor , and a group of women  gets pushed into a table, the legs scraping\\nacross the floor .\\n“Kaleb!” I cry .\\nCici takes her opportunity while he’s distracted, shoving me in the\\nchest, and I stumble back, my eyes burning with anger . Noah grabs my\\nhand and yanks me away , my eyes burning into hers as she disappears in the\\ncrowd.\\nHe pulls me across the bar, and I look back at the pit of brawlers on the\\ndance floor, not seeing Kaleb anywhere. Do they have him on the floor or\\nsomething?\\nThe bartender leaps over the bar with a baseball bat, and Jake takes me\\nfrom Noah as Noah runs back for his brother .\\n“Are you okay?” Jake asks.\\nI nod quickly , too worried about  the boys. I can’t even say someone else\\nstarted it. Kaleb technically made the first move.\\nHis kiss still warms my forehead.\\n“Get in the truck .” Jake shoves his keys at me and pushes me toward the\\ndoor.\\nI step backward, the music stopped and bystanders watching the fight.\\nMy heart hammers in my chest, feeling like this is my fault for some\\nreason, but I know it’ s not.\\nIf I weren’ t here, though… Jake digs through the fray, finding his sons, and I spin around, running\\noutside and to our truck parked on the curb.\\nSnow falls, fat flakes hitting my hair and bare shoulders, and I rip off\\nmy heels, jogging across the frigid, wet pavement to the truck.\\nClimbing in, I toss my heels in the back and start the engine.\\nI shiver , turning  on the heaters and starting the wipers. Thankf ully, the\\nwindows haven ’t frosted yet, and I blow into my hands, trying to warm\\nthem up. I left my shawl inside, dammit.\\nThe door to the bar flies open, and I look over, seeing Kaleb charge out,\\nfollowed quickl y by his father and brother . He heads around the truck for\\nthe driver ’s side.\\n“Are you okay?” I ask as he opens the door .\\nBut I know I won’ t get an answer .\\nPushing me over, he climbs in and shifts the truck into first as Jake\\ntakes the seat next to me and Noah climbs in the back.\\nI take the hint and scurry into the back seat to join him.\\nThe bar door opens again and guys rush out, Terrance leading the pack,\\nand I barely have time to look at Kaleb before he shifts gears again, putting\\nthe truck in reverse this time.\\n“Aw, fuck,” Noah says like he knows what Kaleb is about to do, and I\\nwhip my head around just as Kaleb slams on the gas. Our truck heads\\nstraight for a row of bikes, and I grapple for the handle above my door,\\ntaking hold of it and squeezing my eyes shut as the truck drive s right over\\nthe dirt bikes.\\n“Kaleb!” Jake yells.\\nBut it’s too late. We rock side to side, crawling over the moto rcycles,\\nand my heart lodges in my throat, but I almost want to laugh, too.\\nThey deserved that.\\n“You motherfucker!” I hear someone yell.\\nAnd then a loud bark. “Y ou’re dead!”\\nI look out the window and suddenly see two cops across the street,\\ndressed in heavy jackets and winter hats as they step out of their cruiser .\\n“Oh, shit,” I gasp.\\n“Kaleb, go now!” Noah yells, seeing what I’m seeing.\\nHe doesn’ t hesitate further . Before the officers can stop him, Kaleb hits\\nthe gas, speeds off, and I look out the rear window , seein g the guys\\nscramble for their bikes and the cops jump back in their car . The truck races through the night, the snow whipping across the\\nwindshield in the black night, and I slip my shoes back on.\\nKaleb kills the headlights, as if the whole town doesn’ t know where\\nwe’re going, and I peer over the back of his seat, trying to see what he sees\\nin his rearview mirror .\\nLights trail us far back, and I hear the tires spin underneath us as the\\nslick snow turns to ice. Jake flips on the defroster .\\n“Are they really chasing us in this weather?” I blurt out, looking behind\\nme. “Maybe you should stop.”\\nThey’re on dirt bikes. It’s freezing. This could get a lot worse than it\\nalready has if there’ s an accident.\\nNo one hears me, though.\\n“Slow down,” Jake orders him.\\nBut Kaleb doesn’ t listen. The truck fishtails, and Kaleb jerks the wheel\\nto the shoulder , using the gravel for traction as he gets us farther and farther\\nup into the mountains.\\nThe bikes gain on us, since they’re carrying less weight, but then I see a\\ncouple of headlights drop as if the bikes slid. The others follow Kaleb’ s\\nexample and use the shoulder as the cops’ red and blue lights flash behind.\\nNo, no, no… This is bad.\\nWe keep  going,  and I notice less lights behind us now as some of the\\nracers giving chase decide to give up in the thick snowfall and save it for\\nanother day .\\nWhy are we running, though? A bar fight isn’t a big deal, but Kaleb\\ndestroying prope rty is. The pursuit won’ t end once we’re behind our front\\ndoor.\\nAll of a sudden , the police lights disappear . I watch their headlights,\\nseeing them turn around and head back to town, as well.\\nThey know where to find Kaleb tomorrow , I guess.\\nThe tires skid under us, and the truck starts sailing backward. I suck in a\\nbreath, digging my nails into the back of Kaleb’ s seat. We shouldn’ t be\\ndoing this.\\n“Oh, my God,” I mumble, looking down the cliff on my side of the\\ntruck, fear paralyzing me at the drop.\\nThe bikes behind us struggle to climb the road, and just as I’m about to\\nsuggest we stop or get out to walk back to the house, since we’re less than a\\nmile away, Kaleb turns the wheel right and takes us off the road. The truck plummets into a ditch, and he punches the gas, taking us up into the forest,\\nthe truck moving more steadily through the trees.\\nI look behind me, seeing the bikes fall behind, lost in the darkness,\\nsnow , and without Kaleb’ s taillights to follow , they won’ t know where\\nthey’re going.\\nI don’ t think I breathe the entire way home.\\nKaleb drives over the forest floor , taking us up to the house, and when\\nhe pulls the truck to a stop, we all climb out, looking around for any sign of\\nthe cops or racers.\\n“Get inside now!” Jake orders.\\nWe run into the house, slamming the door behind us, and Noah falls\\nback on the door , breathing hard.\\nWhat did we do?\\nThere’ s going to be a punishment for that. They won’ t let it go.\\nAll of a sudden, though, Noah starts laughing.\\nHysterically .\\nI stand up and scowl down at him. “This isn’t funny ,” I growl.\\n“Someone could ’ve died. They’ll still be up here once the snow  stops. The\\ncops will arrest him.”\\nI look at Kaleb, who’ s as cool as a cucumber , moving into the kitchen\\nand whipping of f his shirt like he’ s getting ready for bed or some shit.\\nNoah’ s laughter dies down, and he rises, coming to stand next to me.\\n“The snow won’ t stop,” he tells me.\\nI meet his eyes as he pats my arm.\\n“Until April,” he finishes.\\nAnd he follows Kaleb to the fridge for a beer .  \\n \\n \\nTiernan\\n \\nThere’ s already three inches on my balcony . The snowstorm rages, large\\nclumps of brigh t, white flakes falling to the ground with such density that I\\ncan barely tell it’s night. I let out a silent laugh, peering through the\\nwindows of my double doors. The house is quiet, the guys went to bed long\\nago, but I can’ t sleep. I want to see this.\\nIt’s so beautiful . And for some  reason, I’m in heaven, despite Noah’ s\\ngriping about there being no civilization for the next six months. I have all I\\nneed right here.\\nJake had us tend to the horses before bed, but I still feel bad for them\\nout there in the barn. The snow is definitely sticking, which means the\\nground temperature is as cold as the clouds.\\nI turn around, shivering as I fist my hands under my arms. I should put\\non the long underwear I bought, but I hate pants under the sheets. I walk\\nover, deciding to stay in my silk shorts, button-down Oxford and wrapped\\nin a blanket as I crawl into bed.\\nBut I spot something lying at the bottom of the bed and stop, walking\\nover and picking up Kaleb’ s belt.\\nOr the one he gave to me. I’d tossed it there when I came up earlier .\\nHolding one end, I thread it through my fist, stretching it out to see the\\nornate carvings.\\nHe’s kind of an artist, isn’t he? I picture him working on this, probably\\nin the loft or one of the rooms in the barn I haven’ t explored yet, where he\\nhas a place he won’ t be disturbed. Or maybe in his bedroom. What’ s his room like anyway? I’ve never dared go up there, and the one\\ntime my uncle asked me to fold a load of laundry , none of Kaleb ’s stuff was\\nin the load, so even then I didn’ t have an excuse to go into his room like I\\ndo Noah’ s.\\nI graze my thumb over the dreamcatcher .\\nWhat was he thinking when he carved all this stuff? He must’ve  thought\\nof me.\\nHe spent time on this. A long time.\\nI stare at the notches, absently walking over to my floor -length mirror as\\nI thread the end through the buckle and slip my wrist through the hole.\\nI yank the belt, pulling the rest of it through the buckle and feeling the\\ncool leather tighten around my skin.\\nSomething rises up my throat, almost like vomit but almost like my\\nstomach and how it’s flipping,  too. My chest rises and falls in shallow\\nbreaths.\\nI look in the mirror .\\nThe belt fits like a cuff on my wrist, the slack hanging, and I stop\\nbreathing, the image of Kaleb grabbing it and tying it to his bed above some\\ngirl’s head flashing in my mind.\\nHe yanks the strap, her body jerking, and I whimper .\\nJesus. I shake my head and take it of f, tossing it back on the bed.\\nI’m not old enou gh for that. And…I have two wrists. He only gave me\\none belt. Nice little scare you tried to give me, Noah.\\nI shiver again, looking over at my fire. Out of wood. Great.\\nI drop my blank et on the bed and hurry down the hallway , joggin g down\\nthe stairs. I’m not going into the shop. It’ s too frickin’ cold.\\nThe fire in the great room still crackles, and I hurry over to the stockpile\\nnext to the fireplace.\\nBut I can’ t resist.\\nI turn around and bend over just slightly , letting the heat warm the back\\nof my thighs. I face my fingers to the flames as well, wigglin g them and\\nbasking in the heat.\\nI tip my head up and see Kaleb sitting in the high back leather chair not\\nthree feet away , watching me.\\nA shotgu n lays across his lap, and he holds the neck of a beer bottle in\\nhis fingers.\\nI straighten, the hair on my arms standing on end. “Is everything okay?” He slouc hes a little, his long legs bent ninety degrees at the knees as the\\nfirelight flashes across his bare chest.\\n“I know  you understand me,” I say. “I know you can nod. Or write or\\nsomething. Why don’ t you want to talk to me?”\\nThe light makes his eyes glow as he watches, and I frown.\\nHe acts like an animal. He just eats and sleeps and…\\nThe shop door opens and closes, and I pull my eyes away from Kaleb to\\nsee Noah, walking through the great room.\\nHe looks over at me as he also carries a shotgun.\\n“Can’ t sleep, either?” he asks.\\nI watch him check the locks. “It was cold,” I reply . “I came to get more\\nwood.”\\nWhy are they both still up? And armed? I thought we were safe.\\n“Watch a movie with us?” he suggests.\\n“I thought you said they couldn’ t get up here,” I say instead.\\nHe plops down on the couch, propping up the weapon on the arm of the\\nsofa. “They can’ t.”\\n“So why are you both up guarding the place?”\\n“Precaution.”\\n“For what?” I press, almost amused. “Is your plan really to open  fire on\\npolice of ficers if they show up?”\\nNoah shakes his head. “Not them.”\\nI shoot a look to Kaleb, who watches the fire as he takes a drink of his\\nbeer, and then back to Noah.\\nHe must see a puzzled expression on my face, because he’s quick to\\nexplain.\\n“Holcomb and his cronies know that we’re safe from them up here\\nduring the winter ,” he points out, “but also…whatever and whoever is in\\ntown… is safe from us, too.” He grabs the beer on the end table and twists\\noff the top, tossing it next to the lamp. “If the snow isn’t as thick as we\\nwant, I wouldn’ t put it past him to ambush us tonight and try to take you\\nback down the mountain before we woke up and lost our chan ce to follow\\nyou in the weather .”\\nSo…\\nI glance between them. “Y ou’re guarding me?”\\nHe feigns a smile as his only answer .\\nThey’re awake at one in the morning, armed and alert for me? “Awwwww ,” I croon, faking teary eyes and putting my hand to my\\nheart.\\n“Shut up,” Noah grumbles.\\nI laugh quietly , walking into the kitchen and grabbing a beer from the\\nfridge.\\n“So, what will happen, then?” I ask, sitting cross-legged on the couch\\nnext to Noah. “When the snow melts, will Kaleb be in trouble?”\\nWhat happened tonight was the locals’ fault, but I know if I wasn’ t here\\nit wouldn’ t have happened at all.\\n“It’s not your fault,” Noah assures me, pointing the remote and clicking\\nthe TV on. “They were looking for you for a reason.”\\n“Why?”\\nHe takes a deep breath and sighs. “Because for some people, it’s not\\nenough that they have their share,” he explains. “They want it all.”\\nI study him as he scrolls the streaming choices. I’m not sure I know\\nwhat he’s talking about, but at least it sounds like this didn’ t start with me. I\\npull the blanket off the back of the sofa and cover up my legs, taking a\\ndrink of my beer .\\nThe room falls quiet as we view the selections, but I’m not\\nconcentrating very hard. Noah is dressed in black pajama pants and a white\\nsleeveless T-shirt, his skin still so tan and smooth, and I want to roll my\\neyes at myself for noticing. I just don’t get many opportunities to lounge\\naround with them. They often stay up to watch TV at night,  but I’m so\\nwiped by the end of the day , I’m aching for my bed.\\nHe settles on a film, something with Tom Cruise when he was younger ,\\nand I lie my head back, holding my beer as I try to watch.\\nThe only thing I know about  this movie is that he dances in his\\nunderwear , and I find myself constantly looking at Kaleb to see any sign of\\namusement. Or perhaps a foot tap to the music.\\nBut his face is hidden behind the curve of the chair back, and his body\\nbarely shifts during the film.\\nThere’ s a decent soundtrack by Tangerine Dream, though.\\nUnfortunately , Tom (or Joel) is a good kid, trying to lose his virginity at the\\nbehest of his stupid friends when his parents go out of town for a few days.\\nSo what does he do? He hires a hooker and turns his parents’ house into a\\nbrothel. It’s nothing more than a teen male fantasy , and I can’t believe this\\nis the movie that turned him into a household name. I roll my eyes and cross my arms over my chest. “This film is so dumb.”\\n“Is it?” Noah asks, watching Joel and Lana have sex—in publi c—on a\\ntrain. “Y our laughing over there is sending me mixed signals.”\\nI never laughed. The comedy is subpar .\\n“This was similar to how I lost my virginity ,” Noah offers, taking a swig\\nof his beer .\\nI cock an eyebrow and look over at him. “A prostitute?”\\n“An older woman who only wanted one thing.”\\n“Your money?”\\nI hear a breathy laugh and look over, seeing Kaleb’ s chest and stomach\\nshake a little. Did I just…? Did he just…?\\nOh, my God. He laughed. At my joke.\\nI finish my beer and set the bottle on the coffee table, the glow from the\\nfire the only thing lighting the dark room. “Well, I’m sorry things didn’ t go\\nbetter for both of you tonight.”\\n“What do you mean?”\\n“Last chance for overnight visitors,” I tease. “Nothing to play with this\\nwinter .”\\nNoah sits there a moment, looking like he’s contemplating something.\\n“Maybe,” he says.\\nI narrow my eyes.\\nMaybe…\\nI nod. “You’re right. I mean, you can’t be the only people up here,\\nright?” I ask. “There have to be other mountain men?”\\nHe looks over at me. “Excuse me?”\\n“More warm bodies,” I clarify , maintaining a straight face. “There have\\nto be more guys  holed up in cabins up here, right? It’s okay . It happens in\\nprison. Gay for the stay .”\\nHis eyebrows shoot up. “Excuse me?”\\nBut before I can answer , he launches over, grabs my legs and pulls me\\ndown the couch toward him as he jabs me in my ribs.\\nI try to hold back my laughter , but a little bit escapes. “Stop.”\\n“What did you say?” He pokes my inner thighs, and I slap at his hands.\\n“Well, you are kind of metro.”\\n“And what about you?”\\n“What about me what?” I curl, shielding myself from his finge rs in my\\nstomach. “I saw you dancing with Cici at the race.” He leans over me, continuing\\nhis attack of jabs. “Maybe same-sex heat turns you on.”\\nI let out sad, little laughs but plead at him with my eyes. “Stop it.” I\\nshove his hands away , but they keep coming back. “I mean, it’s okay . You\\nhave to cope with the seclusion somehow , right?”\\nHe growls and grabs my feet, tickling the underside. I kick, laughing\\nhard. “Stop it!”\\nBut then, all of a sudden, he grabs me by the collar and pulls me up onto\\nhis lap.\\nHe wrap s his arms around me, whispering in my ear. “You wanna see\\nhow we really cope with the seclusion?”\\nMy smile falls, my laughter gone, and I watch as he scrolls the TV’s\\nfiles and finally clicks on one.\\nMy ass is planted firmly in his lap, my back against his chest , and all\\nI’m aware of is his body underneath mine, through the thin fabric we wear .\\nThe screen goes black, the whol e room cast in darkness again except for\\nthe fire, and Noah sits back, pulling me with him.\\nI tense.\\nAnother soft glow lights up the room, but I’m afraid to raise my eyes\\nbecause I know what he put on the TV .\\nI can’ t look.\\nBut I don’ t want to leave, either .\\nI hear kissing. And rain.\\nThe acting is bad—my face warms with embarrassment for them—\\nbut… I don’ t know .\\nI stay sitting there on top of Noah.\\nIt’s a boy and girl in the film. Teenagers. They’re making out in their\\ncar, and I can tell from the conv ersation that they’re in the woods on a rainy\\nnight. Secluded and alone.\\nOr so they think.\\nI look up, taking in the gradient picture of the porno, the windows of\\ntheir car fogged up as the rain pounds the roof, but then flashing lights\\nappear and two cops are knocking on their window .\\nNoah holds me, rubbing his thumb over the back of my hand as we\\nwatch.\\n“No, please,” the young guy on the movie begs the cops. “I don’t have\\nmoney for all that. I’ll pay it. Can we just for get about this?” Apparently , the loser has a couple warrants for unpaid tickets and\\nexpired insurance. They want to take him to jail.\\nBut then, of course, they flash their lights inside the car and get a good\\nlook at his little girlfriend.\\nCop #1 cocks his head and of fers the idiot a Get-Out-of-Jail-Free card.\\nI watch as the two uniformed officers pull the girl out of the car and\\ncoerce her into compliance. Her boyfriend can go home, the warrants\\nerased, and her daddy will never have to pick her up at the station tonight. If\\nshe gives them what they want.\\nThe rain drenches her little white blouse which she has tied up under her\\nbreasts, her nipples and skin showing clear through the wet fabric as the cop\\nlooks hungrily at them. An ache settles between my legs, pulsating and\\nwarm.\\n“This is what we do,” Noah whispers in my ear. “This is what we do to\\nget through the winter , Tiernan.”\\nI glance over at Kaleb, his face hidden, but I see his chest and stomach\\nrising and falling with his quickened breathing.\\n“It’s what you’ll do, too,” Noah adds.\\nWith them? Or…\\nI drop my eyes, hearing the girl’ s clothes tearing.\\nNoah’ s breathin g turns ragged, and he shifts under me, his cock\\nhardening and rubbing me.\\nI draw in a breath.\\n“You should go to bed now ,” he says in a low voice.\\nGently , he pushes me off his lap and scoots down in his seat, getting\\nmore comfortable as the officer shoves the young girl up against her\\nboyfriend’ s window, her bare tits pressing against the wet glass so he can\\nwatch.\\nI slide down the sofa, and I should leave. I…\\nHe pulls down her shorts, rips off her shirt, and pulls her pantie s aside,\\ngripping her hair as he pushes inside of her .\\nShe whimpers, looking guilty and shy, but she doesn’ t protest as the\\nshot slides to her boyfriend inside the car who watches her wet tits bounce\\nagainst the glass as she gets fucked right in front of him.\\nI look over at Noah and see he’s not watching the movie. He’s watching\\nme. “Last chance,” he says softly , rubbing his cock through his pants. “You\\nshould leave.”\\nBut I don’t want to. Heat rises to my cheeks, but I pull the blanket over\\nmy legs and hold his eyes as he gives me a few more seconds to make sure\\nI’m sure.\\nA grin plays on his mouth, but the humor he always has is gone. He’s\\nhot right now. His muscles are tense, his eyes are on fire, and he knows\\nwe’re about to cross a line.\\nHolding my gaze, he reaches inside his black pants, stroking himself\\nunder the fabric and watching me for a reaction. But when I don’t move, he\\ntakes it out.\\nMy eyes flash  to what he holds in his hand, and my stomach\\nimmediately starts swirling with heat and butterflies.\\nShit.\\nHe’s thick and hard, the fireligh t dancing across the fat tip, and I watch\\nas he pulls off his T-shirt and licks his hand, stroking himself up and down\\nagain and again, never taking his eyes of f me.\\n“You wanna watch?” he whispers so quietly I almost can’ t hear it.\\nYes. His beautiful body glows and flexes as he strokes himself, and I\\nlick my lips, just wanting this one thing. I just want to see.\\nHe quirk s a smile and looks back at the TV, while I watch him and the\\nfilm, both of them making my heart pump faster and harder . I feel the\\nslickness betwee n my legs and lean back against the arm, the girl’s moans,\\nthe cops’ grunts , and the boys’  breathing filling our small space as sweat\\nglistens across Noah’ s chest.\\nThe girl is being used so hard, the first cop coming inside her and\\nsqueezing her breasts, while the second one immediately throws her into the\\nback seat of her boyfriend’ s car, undoes his trousers and comes down on top\\nof her , taking his turn.\\nHer boyfriend watches in the rearview mirror , her leg thrown over the\\nfront seat to open her wide as the cop thrusts inside of her, jerking into her\\nbody again and again.\\nI draw short, shallow breaths, the ache between my thighs deep and\\nthrobbing. It hurts low in my belly, and I chew on my bottom lip, seeing the\\nbulge in Kaleb’ s jeans growing.\\nGod. I scoot down, lying back on the sofa and clenching my thighs  against\\nthe discomfort. Noah takes my leg and lays it across his lap, resting his\\nhand on my thigh as he closes his eyes and continues jerking  himself off\\nwith the other one.\\nThe cop sits back, pulls her into his lap, and she rides him backward,\\nstaring at her boyfriend through the rearview mirror .\\n“You slut,” he growls, but you can tell he’ s turned on.\\nShe bites her bottom lip to hide the smile.\\nMoans, cries, skin hitting skin, her wet hair sticking to her body as the\\nboyfriend finally takes his turn on her, and I can barely get a breath as every\\ninch of my body comes alive, my nerves firing under my skin and a need so\\nhard I can’ t stop myself from rubbing the heel of my hand over my pussy .\\nMore nerves fire. I groan.\\nMy hand  under the blanket, I slip my fingers under my shorts, inside my\\npanties, and play with my clit. Kaleb starts rubbing his cock through his\\njeans, and Noah jerks his long and slow, sucking air between his teeth as he\\ngets more excited.\\nI lift up my shirt, the wool fabric of the blanket chafing my nipples in\\nthe best way , and I pull down my shorts just a hair , to fit my hand in easier .\\nI close my eyes, indulging in the fantasy . Indulging in being a part of\\nthis and them, and how no one is here to tell us to stop.\\nDipping my fingers inside, I swirl the wetness all over my clit and rub it\\nfaster and faster , imagining a mouth between my thighs, licking me and\\ntasting me.\\nI rock my body back and forth, thinking about his mouth. His head\\ndown there, taking what he wants and telling me how sweet my pussy is.\\nOh, God. I rub fast and faster , barely noticing the draft or that the\\nblanket has fallen away , because I don’ t care. I don’ t care.\\nMy hips roll, the skin of my nipples tightening in the cool air, I arch my\\nneck back, slipping half my finger inside me and shuddering at the pleasure.\\nGod… It feels so good. I bite the corner of my mouth, needing more.\\nI need mor e. I…\\nIt suddenly registers that the sound is gone. The sound from the movie.\\nThe room is quiet, and I don’t hear her crying out or moaning  anymore. I\\ncontinue to rub circles as I blink my eyes open.\\nNoah and Kaleb aren’ t watching the movie anymore. They’re watching\\nme. I suck in a quick breath, stopping my rubbing.\\nMy mouth falls open, and I look down, seeing my blanket is gone,\\nfallen on the floor . Noah is still in his seat next to me, but he’s not stroking\\nanymore, and Kaleb has risen from his chair , standing and watching me.\\nMy top is pulled up, my breasts exposed, and I pull my hand out of my\\nshorts, unable to speak or barely breathe.\\nShit.\\nI shoot up, but Noah is there, leaning over me before I have a chance to\\nclimb of f the couch.\\n“Don’ t stop,” he whispers.\\nHis eyebrows are pinched together—vulnerable, almost like he’s in\\npain.\\nHe takes my hand. I tense, but I don’t pull away as I watch him sink my\\nfingers into his mouth. The same fingers I was using a moment ago.\\nHe sucks them one by one and then pushes my hand back down\\nbetween my legs.\\n“Rub it again.”\\nNo, I…\\nHe kisses my forehead as he slips his cock back inside his pants.\\n“It’s okay ,” he says. “Rub your clit.”\\nMy body still wracked with need, a trickle of sweat running down my\\nback. Kaleb’ s eyes are trained on me, unblinking and his whole body rigid.\\nI glance between them, nervous, but I slide my fingers back into my\\npanties and play like he wants  me to. Noah’ s eyes slowly fall down my\\nbody , taking everything in.\\n“Look what she’ s been hiding under my clothes,” he says to Kaleb.\\nKaleb moves over to the sofa, sitting behind my head, and I look up,\\nmeeting his eyes. He pushes a lock of hair off my forehead as Noah leaves\\nsweet, light kisses around my face.\\nMy fingers start working harder as both of them hover over me,\\nwatching me.\\n“That’ s it,” Noah says in a strained voice, holding my face as he kisses\\nmy nose and then my lips. “Good girl.”\\nI feel his fingers slip under the waistband of my shorts, and he starts to\\npull them down.\\nI look at him, pleading, “No.”\\n“Yes.” He pulls my shorts and panties down just over my ass, so they can\\nwatch my fingers work between my legs.\\nNoah’ s lips dip to my stomach, trailing down, and on reflex,  I go to\\npush him away with my other hand—or maybe hold him to me, I don’t\\nknow—but Kaleb grips my wrist and pulls my hand back.\\nI meet his eyes, groaning at the little wet circles I’m rubbing over my\\npussy .\\n“Looks like we might have a little something to play with this winter ,\\nafter all,” Noah tells his brother .\\nI twist my lips into a snarl, about to protest, but Noah kisses me quiet.\\n“Shhh,” he whispers.\\nGod, his lips are soft. I pant against his mouth.\\n“Tiernan,” he gasps, watching my hand work on my bare pussy .\\n“Jesus, man,” he tells Kaleb. “Look at her. You ever seen anything that\\npretty? I’ll bet she’ s the tightest thing, too.”\\nHe dips down, licking my nipple, and something shoots through  me like\\nI’m about to fucking explode.\\n“Noah,” I whimper .\\n“Tiernan.” He kisses my flesh, teasing my nipple with his teeth. “I\\nwanna fuck you.” He comes up, hovering over my mouth as he rubs his\\ncock over my hand between my legs. “I wanna fuck you. All winter .”\\nI stare at his mouth, ready to pull down his pants and let him. I look up,\\ncatching Kaleb’ s eyes and holding them as I kiss his brother .\\n“The prettiest one was under our roof the whole time,” Noah groans,\\ngrinding on me. “You’re ours.” He presses his forehead to mine. “Our sweet\\nlittle one. All ours. Do you understand?” He kisses my forehead, my nose,\\nand I move my hand away , liking the feel of his dick more. “Our piece of\\nass. Ours.”\\nYes. I nod. I don’ t care. I don’ t want anyone else.\\nWe seem to be on the same page, because he throws his brother a\\nwarning. “Don’ t bruise her . At least until she’ s used to us.”\\nWhat? I feel like I should be scared, but I look up at Kaleb, seeing him\\nlift his mouth in a dark smile. Right then and there, I don’t care what he\\ndoes to me. I just want it.\\n“I get your cherry,” Noah whispers over my mouth, grinning. “As long\\nas I promise not to touch your ass. He’ll want that.”\\nAnd he tips his chin at his brother . I fist my hands, my stomach knotting but flipping with excitem ent, too,\\nas I arch my neck back for Noah’ s mouth.\\nBut then a stern voice suddenly barks, “Noah.”\\nI freeze, unable to move for a moment.\\nOh, shit.\\nNo.\\nNoah stops his kisses, and I pop my eyes open, recognizing  Jake’ s\\nvoice.\\nNausea rolls through me. I slip my shorts back up and pull down my\\nshirt, covering myself.\\n“What the fuck are you doing?” Jake growls.\\nNoah lifts up, and I can see the strain and struggle on his face, before\\nhis gaze levels and he gives a tight smirk.\\nHe stands up and turns toward his father . “Nothing she doesn’ t want.”\\nI sit up, Kaleb rising to his feet behind me, and I can’t bring myself to\\nlook at my uncle. Just his bare feet and the bottoms of his jeans as he stands\\non the last stair .\\n“Go to bed,” he says.\\nNoah hesitates, but then he click s the TV off, grabs his shirt, and heads\\nup the stairs, Kaleb following. I’m not sure if they look back at me or if this\\nwhole thing is amusing to them, but I quickly stand up and dart off to\\nfollow .\\n“Not you.” Jake grabs me.\\nI turn my head away , feeling his eyes blaze into me.\\n“What would’ve happened if I hadn’ t come down?” he asks.\\nI don’t know . And I don’t know why I’m embarrassed. Normally , yes, I\\nshould be. Given our familial ties, this is wrong. I can see how people\\nwould see it as wrong.\\nBut it’ s not like he wasn’ t all over me a few weeks ago, too.\\n“What would’ve happened?”\\n“I don’ t know ,” I answer .\\nWhy didn’ t I ask them that?\\n“What did you want to happen?” he asks.\\nI can only shrug , meeting his eyes as I search for words. “I… I don’t\\nknow .”\\n“You don’t know?” He rips my blanket away and steps down, gripping\\nmy upper arms as he backs me into the living room again. “What did you want to happen?”\\n“I don’ t know!” I cry . “I…”\\n“What?”\\n“I…”\\nWhy am I the one in trouble? Is he really angry?\\nOr just disappointed?\\n“What did you want to happen?”\\n“I wante d it all to happen,” I utter, finally looking back up at him with\\ntears in my eyes. “I don’t know what’ s wrong with me. I just…I feel it\\neverywhere.”\\nHe stares at me, his eyes narrowed. “Y ou feel what everywhere?”\\n“You,” I whisper , dropping my eyes. “And them.”\\nThis place, the house, the land, the wind…them. I’m alive.\\n“You get hard, you feel it,” I remind him of our night in the kitchen.\\n“Am I not supposed to feel it, too?”\\n“You’re seventeen!”\\n“Eighteen,” I growl back. “I could’ve screwed anyone by now. My\\nparents never cared, but I did.” I look up at him as he brings me close, his\\nhot, angry breaths falling over my forehead. “No one ever felt right… b-\\nbefore.”\\nHe holds me, squeezing my arms and seething.\\nHis fists clench, his fingers digging into my skin, and I whimper .\\n“Jake…”\\nIt hurts.\\nHe drops me and twists me around, bending me over one arm. I barely\\nhave time to suck in a breath before his hand lands hard on my ass, a loud\\nslap piercing the air .\\nI gasp, squeezing my eyes shut in shock.\\n“Still feeling good?” he asks, breathing hard.\\nI don’t look at him. Rage boils my blood, and part of me wants to\\nscream and hit back, but another part of me…\\nAnother part of me feels the knots loosen in my stomach. My heart\\njumps and the adrenaline runs.\\nStill feeling good?\\nSlowly , I nod.\\nWhat the fuck are you going to do to me? For some reason, I’m\\nemboldened. I want to find out. He’s quiet for a moment, and then I hear his threat. “Y ou want more?”\\nI nod twice.\\nHe still holds me, and I rise back  up, feeling the muscles in his arm tight\\nand hard, and his body , almost like it’ s vibrating. I can’ t hear him breathe.\\nHe’s so hard. I know he is.\\n“Take of f your shorts,” he bites out. “So you can feel my hand.”\\nMy pulse fills my ears, and my hands start shaking, but I push my shorts\\ndown my legs, standing in my shirt and underwear .\\nHe sits on the couch, leaning back, and looks at me, his eyes trailing\\nover my body and down to between my legs.\\n“Come here,” he instructs. “Over my lap, princess.”\\nMy nerves shake so badly , but still—my pussy clenches when he says\\n‘princess’. I want him to say it again.\\nSlowly , I crawl across his lap and lie down on my stomach as he lays an\\narm across my back to hold me down.\\nI don’ t want his hand. I just want his fingers.\\nHe peels down my panties, and my breath catches, closing my eyes on\\nreflex at the shame.\\nBut I like it. I want it. I want him to do whatever he wants. I—\\nHe slaps my ass, pain spreading across my right cheek as I jerk and\\nwhimper .\\nHe lets out a breath, and I swear , I almost hear him groan.\\nHe spanks me again and again, fire coursing under my skin, and I\\nclench the blanket on the sofa as I throw my head back and cry out.\\n“Three,” he growls. “Y ou going to let those boys touch you again?”\\nI shake my head. “No.”\\nHe slaps me again, and I wince even as my ass arches up to meet it.\\n“No, what?” he whispers.\\n“No, Uncle Jake,” I answer properly .\\nHis hand lands on my bare ass again. “Five,” he breathes out. “You\\ngoing to let them see your body?”\\nAnother slap.\\n“No,” I whimper . “No.”\\nAnd another one.\\n“You’ll be good?”\\n“Yes, Jake.” I grind my pussy into his leg as sweat beads my brow . “I’ll\\nbe good. I’ll be good.” He spanks me again, and I thrust forward, the pulse in my clit pounding.\\nGod, I’m so wet. I bury my hand into the sofa. I need him. I need his cock.\\nAgain. Again. Again. Faster and faster , he spanks my little ass. Again\\nand again and again, and I feel his hard cock trying to poke through his\\njeans.\\nI moan, thrust, and ache, my panties stretching across my uppe r thighs\\nas I try to widen my legs, but fuck… God, I’m so wet.\\n“You’ll be good?” He slaps me again, and I feel it. It’s almost there. I’m\\nalmost coming.\\n“Yes,” I gasp. “Y es, yes, yes…”\\nI grip the blanket, breathing hard and waiting for another spank.\\nBut…it doesn’ t come.\\nI clench my thighs, every muscl e in my body as tight as a rubber band,\\nbut he stops. Oh, God, please . He pulls up my panties, and tears fill my\\neyes, because I’m in pain. It hurts, and between Noah, Kaleb, and now Jake,\\nI’m going insane.\\nLifting me up, he pulls my shirt down and kisses my damp forehead, my\\nnose, and my cheeks.\\nHe’s stopping, and I close my eyes to keep from crying.\\nHis fingers swipe between my legs, and I watch him bring them up,\\nglistening with what’ s dripping out of me and onto my thigh. He looks at\\nhis fingers as he rubs them together .\\n“Don’ t make me do this again,”  he tells me, his lips tight. “It hurts us\\nboth.”\\nAnd he pushes me away from him, his hard footfalls on the stairs\\nechoing through the house before he slams the door to his bedroom.\\nThe tears stream  down my face as I sit there, my orgasm rolling away\\nand my body screaming with need.\\nI can’ t do this.\\nI won’ t survive the fucking winter .  \\n \\n \\nJ a k e\\n \\nThis fucking girl.\\nHer defiance and how she challenges me at every turn, her silent\\ntreatment over the past week like a screw twisting deeper and deeper into\\nmy skull while her beautiful, unhappy eyes at other times pull at me like\\nhooks in my heart.\\nThis isn’ t my fault. She was lucky I was there. Is that how she wanted to\\nbe made love to for the first time? T wo at once?\\nThey don’ t love her .\\nSure, they’re attracted to her, probably more than any woman, but Noah\\nisn’t serious about anything and Kaleb doesn’ t let anyone in. I was so happy\\nwhen she came back after the funeral, but I was worried a winter with her\\nwould be too much of a temptation.\\nFor me.\\nHow the hell did I not consider the shit they would pull, too?\\nAnd it makes everything worse  when she doesn’ t have the least bit of\\nshame. She strolled downstairs the morning after, refusing to look at me or\\ngive me anything more than one-word responses, but otherwise, not\\ndisplaying the slightest bit of embarrassment. Smiling at Noah when he\\npoured her fucki ng juice and served her some eggs and looking gorgeous in\\nher braids and baseball cap, her tight jeans and Kaleb’ s belt fastened tightly\\naround her hips.\\nGod, she’ s nice to look at. The only remind er of me from the night before that she exhibited at the\\ntable was the wince on her face when she sat her ass that I’d spanked raw\\nthe night before down on the goddamn chair .\\nMy dick swells,  just thinking about how much I wanted her then—half-\\nnaked in my lap and the sweet smell of her sweat as she took her\\npunishment.\\nI groan, shifting as I lean against the tree, the steam from my breath\\nhidden inside my coat. A white tail flicks beyond the dune, and I slowly\\nraise my hand, waving to Tiernan and the boys to focus their attention in\\nthat direction. The boys have been still-hunting for years, and definitely\\nwould’ve bagged this buck by now , but it’ s time to break T iernan’ s cherry .\\nShe takes a careful, quiet step, hiding her breath like I taught her and\\ngently raising her rifle. Norma lly, we’d be in one of the stands we’ve\\nconstructed over the years, but cold weather hunting could sentence us to\\ndays in a tree before we see anything. She has to learn to find her prey .\\nNoah speaks in her ear, walking her through it. Aim, breathe, settle on\\nyour tar get, br eathe… And once your body is in sync with the animal, fire.\\nBut she doesn’ t. She lowers her rifle again and stands up straight.\\nI flex my jaw .\\nI head over, careful to step silently through the cold snow . I reach her\\nand grab her chin, forcing her to look at me.\\nBut she pulls it away . “I can’ t, okay?”\\n“If you don’ t, it’s jarred pickles for the winter .”\\n“Leave her alone,” Noah murmurs. “I’ll do it.”\\nBut before he can turn to raise his gun, I interject. “She’ll do it.” I jerk\\nmy chin for him to go stand by Kaleb, who’ s crouched down up against a\\ntree. “She can pull her weight.”\\n“Screw you,” she bites out.\\nNoah hesitantly backs away toward his brother , keeping his scowl on\\nme as I squat down.\\n“Get your ass down here.” I pull her down with me.\\nI lower my belly to the snow , the chill seeping through my camo, and I\\nthrow her a warning look.\\nA little snarl curls her lips, but she lies down next to me, training her\\neyes on the buck through the foliage.\\nHer white hat covers the tips of her ears, but the lobes are red, as is the\\ntip of her nose. She wears two low pigtails, and I can see her eyes glistening with tears.\\nJesus Christ.\\n“You wanna know what that meat you buy nicely packaged in the\\ngrocery store went through before it came there?” I growl at her. “These\\nanimals have a hell of a lot better life than the meat you buy, girl, so wise\\nup and feed your goddamn family .”\\nHer chin trembles as she stares  at the animal, her jaw flexing. “I hate\\nyou.”\\n“Not as much as you’ll love food in your belly .”\\nShe brings up the weapon, propping her elbows under her and looking\\nthrough the line of sight.\\nShe squeezes the trigger , small sobs escaping her .\\nShe’s going to lose it. She’ll miss, because she can’t see through her\\ntears, and the deer will bolt.\\n“Tiernan,” I say . “Look at me.”\\nThe cloudless blue sky and the smell of ice surrounds us, but even now,\\nlooking at her innocent face and perfect lips, I feel a light sweat cool my\\npores.\\n“Baby , look at me,” I tell her again softly .\\nShe turns her head, her gray pools meeting mine.\\nI wipe a tear from her cheek. “If something happens to me—or the boys\\n—I need to know you can survive up here.” I speak softly , swiping my\\nthumb under her eye to catch another tear before it falls. “What  we have in\\nthe pantry will only last so long. I need to teach you this, okay?”\\nShe trembles but nods, looking so sweet and vulnerable. God, my heart\\naches.\\nI lean in, placing a kiss on her temple. “The thought of you unprotected\\nkills me. Please do this.”\\nShe swallows and takes a deep breath, calming her tears and breathing\\nbefore lining up her sight again.\\n“Okay ,” she whispers.\\nI watch her, not the buck, and I’m mesmerized. So innocent and pure.\\nUntouched and just coming alive for the first time. Something so big is just\\ncontained under  her surface, and I want to feel it all come apart in my arms.\\nTiernan is a pulse in the house.\\nShe’s the pulse. Maybe I was jealous that night I found Noah on top of her and Kaleb\\nlooking at her like a starved animal. Or maybe I was afraid of what this\\nwould do to her. We all wanted her before the snow , and now she’s a\\nconstant reminder that she is all we have to look at the whole winter . I\\nworry that the line I walk on, whether or not we really  need to go without\\nsomething pretty all winter , is starting to blur. If it’s hard now, how hard\\nwill it be to resist her as the cold, dark, and lonely months wear on?\\nBut really , I think what it ultimately comes down to is that I want her .\\nAnd I shouldn’ t.\\nA shot pierces the air, and I blink, coming back to reality . She silently\\nsobs as her head falls and her eyes close, and I grab my binoculars,\\nsearching the terrain for the deer .\\n“She got it!” Noah shouts.\\nHer breathing shakes as she quietly cries, and I know she’s done for the\\nday. She won’ t want to see it.\\n“Go get it,” I tell them. “T ake it home. W e’ll follow .”\\nThe boys walk past, the snow crunching under their boots, and my body\\nburns with the cold seeping through to my skin.\\n“I didn’ t want to disappoint you,” she says, head bowed and staring at\\nthe ground.\\n“You didn’ t.”\\nShe jerks her head toward me, her fierce eyes piercing me. “I did it,\\nbecause I didn’ t want to disappoint you,” she explains. “Why do I care\\nabout pleasing you? I don’ t want to please you.”\\nShe looks away again, pulling off her hat and looking disgus ted with\\nherself.\\nLoose strands of her hair fall in her eyes, and I want to push them away .\\nMy voice sounds strangled as I whisper . “Everything you do pleases\\nme.”\\nI could blame her all I want. Her beauty , her scent, her laughter and\\nfight, her eyes when she smiles  and how she makes us a little happier , the\\nway even a garbage bag would  look good on her as she walks  around my\\nhouse, but hone stly, it’s just what I said. Every day I’m losing  the will to\\nresist and hating myself for it.\\nAnd hating her more for being something I can’ t have.\\n“It’ll be easier next time,” I tell her .\\n“There won’ t be a next time.” “Not unless you want to eat.”\\nShe launches up and swings her fist, slamming me in the jaw as she\\ngrowls. Pain shoots through my face, and the next thing I know , she’s\\npounding on me as she cries.\\nI turn my face away , trying to protect myself as I grab her wrists. Taking\\nthem both in my fists, I flip her over and come down on top of her, still\\nfeeling her body through the layers of clothes we wear .\\nShe wiggles her hands free, struggling underneath me, and blood starts\\nrushing to my groin as she squirms and moves.\\n“I hate you,” she gasps, hitting me. “I hate you. Y ou’re a fucking joke.”\\nI snarl, trying to catch her flailing fists. Y ou little bitch.\\n“My parents sent me to you because they hated me.” She tries to push\\nme off her. “They wanted me to suffer, and you were the wors t they could\\ndo to me.”\\n“Maybe…” I bite out, cutting her off. “Maybe they felt bad about what\\nthey took from me, so they gave me you.” I grip the back of her scalp and\\npull her up to my mouth. “A payment on their debt. That’ s what you are,\\nTiernan. A fucking payment.”\\nHer body shake s as she looks up into my eyes, that same desperate\\npassion I saw in the kitchen that night I first kissed her .\\nShe whispers against my mouth, tears still thick in her voice, “A\\npayment you’ll never collect, because you’re too old and bitter  to spend it\\nright.”\\nMy eyes flare.\\nAnd my dick is rock hard.\\nI crush her mouth with mine, eating her breath and sucking her lips so\\nhard she whimpers.\\nBut she kisses me back. Fuck, yeah, she does.\\nI rip open her coat, stick my hand under her sweater and then under her\\nshirt, filling my hand with her plump tit.\\nShe moans, turning her head left and then right, biting and kissing my\\nmouth in a frenzy as she rips open my hunting pants and sticks her hand\\ndown my jeans, grabbing my cock.\\n“Ah,” I groan, thrusting against her palm. “T iernan.”\\nShe pumps me, dipping her tongue into my mouth to taste and feed, and\\nthe world is spinning behind my eyelids. I want her in my bed. I want her\\nnow. I press my forehead to hers, hugging her to me. She’ s exquisite.\\nAnd ours. Fuck her father .\\nOur bodies start moving as I thrust into her hand and she rolls her hips\\nto meet me, both of us panting  and kissing until I’m ready to rip off her\\ngoddamn clothe s, but it’s fucking freezing, and I can’t do this here. I don’t\\nwant to stop long enough to get her home, either .\\n“Fuck, man, watch your step,”  Noah shouts, and I suck in a frigid\\nbreath.\\nShe continues to trail kisses down my neck, but then she stops, both of\\nus listening to the snow crunching with their steps.\\nShit.\\nI let go of her breast and pull her shirt and sweater down before taking\\nher hand of f my dick. “Get in the fucking truck,” I bite out in a whisper .\\nI stand up, seeing Noah walking behind Kaleb who has the buck slung\\nover his shoulders, and I immediately turn, fastening up my snow pants.\\nFuck.\\nShe should be one of theirs. Why did I stop them the other night? If I\\nhad let them go, this wouldn’ t be happening.\\nTiernan rises, and I take her gun and pick up my own, walking back to\\nthe trucks and feeling her follow me.\\n“We’ll follow ,” I tell the boys as they unload the deer into the bed of the\\nblack Chevy . “Get started on that deer .”\\n“Yup,” Noah cheers, cracking open a beer as he strips of f his outerwear .\\nI start the other truck, turning on the heater as Tiernan opens the back\\ndoor across from me and pulls off her coat and hunting pants, tossing them\\ninto the bed.\\nI slam my door and round the truck, slipping off my coat and tossing it\\ninto the back with one hand and wrapping my other arm around her .\\nI squeeze her, breathing in her hair as I hide us on the other side of the\\ncab, out of the boys’ view .\\nShe turns around, sliding her hands under my shirt and up my stomach\\nas I try to pull of f her sweater .\\n“Yo, Tiernan!” Noah shouts.\\nI cock an eyebrow through the open door, at the frosted window . He\\ncan’t see us as I pull her sweater  over her head, our bodies rubbing together\\nas she unbuttons her flannel.\\n“Ride with us,” he calls. “W e have beeeeeer .” She pants, staring at my mouth, and I grab her hips, crushing her body\\nto mine.\\n“They can take me home,” she whispers over my lips. “If you want.”\\nI groan, my fucking cock stretching painfully inside my pants.\\nTaking her in my arms, I hug her to me again, kissing her deep. “No,” I\\nmouth over her lips. “Stay with me.”\\nShe looks up at me, desperate, and nods.\\nWorking her jeans, I open them up and slide my hand down, stroking\\nher pussy as she whimpers, gripping my shirt.\\nI smile a little.\\n“Get going!” I shout back to the boys. “I’ll bring her home!”\\nMy eyelids flutter at the soft, bare skin and the hot, little cunt sending\\nheat coursing through my hand, up my arm, and through my body .\\nGod, she feels incredible. I trace my lips over her forehead, kissing her\\nas I rub her. “Killing the deer isn’t the only part of putting food on the\\ntable!” Noah barks. “She needs to learn this!”\\nI growl as she moans.\\n“She’ s pulling her weight today!” I yell. “Go!”\\nI hear her soft laugh as she trails kisses up my neck. I close my eyes,\\nhearing the other truck take of f.\\nFuck yes.\\nI grab the back of her neck and bring her in, covering her mouth with\\nmine as her little pigtails hang on by a prayer . I move over her mouth as she\\nhungrily nibbles  mine, and I peer over, never taking my lips off hers as I\\nwatch the taillights of the other truck disappear over the darkening hill.\\nThe sun has already set. It’ s going to be dark soon, but I don’ t care.\\nThe truck rounds a bend and then…it’ s gone.\\nI whip off my flannel, and she pulls off my T-shirt as I dive for her neck\\nand pull down her pants.\\nI just get them over the hump of her ass, pulling her long underwear\\nwith them, and look down as I stroke her bare pussy .\\n“No panties?” I breathe out.\\nHer shirt falls down both arms, and she leans back into my hold, tipping\\nher head  back as my mouth grazes down her neck, down to her firm,\\nbeautiful breasts, and down her tummy to the V between her thighs. I lick\\nand nibble, tugging on her skin, the warmth and taste sending my head\\nspinning. She holds my head as I kiss her pussy and try to get her fucki ng tight\\njeans down her thighs.\\n“I’m cold,” she gasps.\\nI come back up, wrapping my arms around her and kissing her. “I can’t\\npause long enough to get you inside the damn truck,” I chuckle.\\nShe sucks my lips, eating me up, but pushes away after a moment and\\nhops up into the truck and onto the seat. She leans back on her hands and\\nlooks at me, giving me a coy , little grin as she holds out her foot.\\nI smile and pull off her boot. Then I take the other one and toss them\\nboth into the bed. But as she backs up farther into the truck , I grab her\\nankles and pull her back down,  her shirt hanging off one shoulder and the\\nsight of her tight, hard nipples making my mouth go dry. I grab her jeans\\nand yank them down her legs, tossing them into the front seat and she\\nthrows her shirt up there, too.\\nI climb in.\\nSlamming the door, I lean over her as she backs up to the other side,\\ngiving me room. I let my eyes fall down her body , the only clothing she has\\nleft is thigh-high white socks with a couple blue and white stripes at the top.\\nShe leans back on her hands but bends her knees up, crossing her legs at the\\nankles as her eyes fall, feeling shy .\\nOne pigtail drapes over her chest, and I take it, running it through my\\nfingers.\\nPlease, someone stop me. Please.\\nI take the back of her knee and pull her leg aside, spreading her thighs\\nopen for me. Her pussy , pink and tight and beautiful, sits there for the\\ntaking, but…\\nFuck.\\nI drop my head, losing my breath.\\n“I’m holding onto my sanity by a thread here, Tiernan,” I grit out. “Stop\\nme. Please, just stop me.”\\nShe arches up, leaving taunting little kisses on my neck, across my jaw,\\nand up my chin to my mouth.\\nI meet her eyes, seeing tears in hers.\\n“You know why my parents sent me to you?” she asks, her voice barely\\na whisper . “Because you’re nothing for anyone to fear .”\\nI tense as she continues her little kisses. “You would never take my inher itance before I was old enough to claim\\nit,” she says, sick amusement in her voice as her fingers glide down my\\nstomach. “It would never occu r to you to force me to live here or,” she\\nkisses my lips as she looks up into my eyes, “or have the balls to stand up to\\nme—a de Haas.”\\nI bare my teeth, my heart pumping wildly . Excuse me?\\n“So don’t worry ,” she breathes out. “I’m not afraid of you. You won’ t\\ntake anything you want. You’re safe. Weak. My father said so.” And then\\nshe gives me a condescending smile. “I was never worried.”\\nShe comes in for another peck, and I jerk my lips away , glaring at her .\\nHe said that, did he?\\nI shoot back, grab Hannes de Haas’ s little girl, and yank her ass down,\\nhearing her whimper as she slides down the seat.\\nI dive down, sinking my mouth into her pink pussy and pressing her\\nthighs wide for me.\\n“Ah,” she cries out. “I was joking. I’m sorry .”\\nI wrap my arm under one of her thighs and hold her to me as she arches\\nher back and squirms.\\n“You’re what?” I challenge, swirling my tongue in steady , hard circles\\nover her little nub.\\n“S-sorry ,” she stammers. “I’m sorry , Jake. Oh, God.”\\nThat’ s fucking right. I want that piece of shit to hear his little girl\\nscream my name wherever the hell he is. I want him to know how much she\\nloves her Uncle Jake.\\nI suck her and lick, nibbling and kissing around her pussy and inner\\nthighs and teasing her little hole with the tip of my tongue. She moans when\\nI do that, and I do it again, savor ing her taste and tightness. My cock bulges\\nand seeps, and I continue eatin g her while I undo my hunting pants and\\njeans. Jesus. Just thinking about how tight she is…\\nShe digs her nails into her thighs, and I suck on her clit, chewing it\\ngently as her stomach rises and falls, faster and faster .\\nI lift up, rubbin g her little nub with my thumb and watching her tits\\nmove up and down. “I’m so glad you came to live with us, baby ,” I say.\\n“You want me to stop?”\\nHer eyes watch my hand work. “No,” she rushes out in a whisper .\\n“Please do it some more.”\\nShe claws down her thighs. “Do what some more?”\\n“Lick me.”\\n“Lick your what?” I tease, making the little bitch eat her words about\\nme being weak.\\n“My pussy ,” she says, wetting her lips. “I like it when you do that.\\nPlease do it some more.”\\nShe falls back to the seat, closing her eyes and rolling her hips into my\\nhand, hungry for me. “Please lick me down there again.”\\nGod, what those words do to me. We should be in a bed. I fist my cock\\nwith one hand, stroking it, while I dip down to keep eating her, because she\\nlikes it so much.\\nI swirl and nibble, suck and lick, syncing with her breaths and going\\nfaster and harder as her lungs fill again and again.\\n“Yes, yes,” she pants her , opening up wider , one leg through the opening\\nbetween the front seats and the other up over the back seat. “Fuck, I’m\\ncoming. Oh, God.” She shakes, her short, shallow breaths wracking through\\nher body . “Oh, God, Jake, you feel so good.”\\nShe sucks in a breath, and I know her or gasm is cresting, and…\\nI stop, my tongue paused on her clit a moment before I raise my head.\\nHer eyes remain  closed, but after a moment, pain is etched across her\\nface, and she blinks her eyes open. She finds me watching her .\\n“No,” she begs. “Don’ t stop. Please. What are you doing?”\\nI leave a little kiss on her clit, feeling the pulse inside throb like she just\\nran a marathon, and I almost feel sorry for her .\\nI rise up, looking down at her .\\n“Jake,” she says, looking like she’ s about to cry .\\nBut then her hands dip between her legs as she tries to finish herself off,\\nbut I take her wrists, pinning them to her sides.\\n“Please.” She squirms with need.\\nI lean down, leaving little kisses on her stomach. “I would never take\\nyour inheritance, because your money doesn’ t interest me,” I tell her\\nbetween kisses.  “It would never occur to me to force you to live here,\\nbecause I don’ t have to. Y ou like me.”\\nI smirk as I trail kisses up to her tits, licking a nipple.\\n“So don’t worry ,” I taunt. “I don’t want you to be afraid of me. I hated\\nyour fucking slimy parents, but they left me a really pretty piece  of ass who\\nlikes it when I lick her pussy .” I cup her betwe en her legs, rubbing my palm over her clit and dipping\\nthe tip of my middle finger into her cunt.\\nHer hips shoot of f the seat.\\nI push her stom ach back down and do it again, swirling some wetness\\naround her .\\nI slide it in a little deeper .\\nShe arches up, grabbing my wrist with both hands. “No…”\\nI kiss her mouth , her soft lips loving me back. “I know . You still have\\nyour cherry. It’s okay ,” I soothe her, bringing more wetness out and swirling\\nit around her pussy . “I’ll get you ready .”\\nKeeping the tip of my finger inside her, I dive down again and start\\nworking her clit, bringing her back and giving her the orgasm I took away\\nin punishment for her smart mouth.\\n“Uncle Jake,” she moans. “Don’ t stop. Please don’ t stop.”\\n“I won’ t, baby ,” I tell her . “It’s yours. T ake it.”\\nSucking and licking, I speed up my mouth as I hear her body get more\\nexcited, panting harder and harder . I dip my finger in and out— just the tip\\n—over and over again, and when she starts coming in for it, planting her\\nhand on the door behind her head to thrust her body to meet my finger , I\\nsmile to myself, because she’s ready to be filled. She knows it’s what she\\nneeds.\\nShe groans, her tits bobbing back and forth, and my mouth and finger\\nwork, I’m dying , because her tight, little cunt around my finge r is lighting\\nmy body on fire. She’s wet and soft, her folds around my finger giving me a\\nsmall taste of what my dick will be feeling in just a minute.\\nHer pussy tightens, her breathing stutters, she bites down on her bottom\\nlip as she squeezes her eyes shut and moans.\\n“Jake!” she cries out, and I feel it. Wetter and hotter , she coats my\\nfinger , and I’m about to fucking come myself.\\nFuck.\\nRising up, I stare down at her as I reach into the center console , pulling\\nout a condom.\\n“No,” she whim pers, rising up and looking up at me. “Bare. Please? I\\nwant to feel all of it my first time.”\\nMy cock twitches, wanting that, too. I don’ t want anything between us.\\nBut I shake my head. “I won’ t be able to pull out of you,” I tell her.\\n“Not the first time.” She kisses my stomach. “Do you usually use rubbers?”\\nI hold her head to me, reveling in her mouth. “Always.”\\nThe last woman I fucked without one was my wife sixteen years ago.\\nShe eyes me. “I’ve been on the pill a long time,” she says. “Fuck me\\nbare.”\\nShe licks my abs, and my stomach tightens.\\nA light layer of sweat coats the back of her neck, and I push her back\\ndown on the seat, coming down  on top of her and covering her mouth with\\nmine.\\nHer hands go to my hips, both of us pushing my jeans and hunting pants\\ndown, and as soon as my dick is free, her hand wraps around the long, hard\\nshaft.\\nEverything swells and heats up, my stomach on fire.\\n“Fuck, T iernan,” I murmur over her lips. “Fuck.”\\nShe licks my lips as I crown her entrance, and I lift up, so I can look\\ndown at her as I push inside.\\n“Spread your legs,” I tell her .\\nShe hangs one through the opening between the front seats and presses\\none into the back seat again, and I grip the door above her head with one\\nhand and her hip with the other, thrusting my hips and pushing my cock\\ninside her .\\n“Ahhh!” she cries out, digging her nails into my chest.\\nMy arms almos t give out. “Tiernan,” I moan, closing my eyes at the\\npleasure. It’ s so hot and tight. Fuck, she’ s wet.\\nShe shakes, her mouth open in surprise or pain, I don’ t know .\\nI lean down to kiss her . “You’re doing good. Just hold onto me.”\\nHer breathing calms, and I hate that I have to do this, but it’s better not\\nto tell her anyway . I slide out, almost all the way , and then thrust, sinking all\\nthe way inside her this time, to the hilt.\\nHer back arches  off the seat, a pained look crossing her face, and she\\nwhimpers, squeezing her eyes shut.\\nI kiss her lips gently . “Good girl.”\\n“Oh, God.”\\nIt takes a moment for her eyes to open, but as soon as her breathing\\ncalms and her body relaxes, she glides her hands up my back and kisses me.\\n“That was the hard part.” I nibble her lips and settle between her thighs.\\n“This is the fun part.” I move, thrusting my cock inside of her, sliding in nice and deep how\\nshe likes it. Her legs fall open more and more, and I hold myself up,\\nlooking down at her body lying open for me and taking me.\\nHer pretty breasts bob back and forth, and I run my free hand up and\\ndown her body , squeezing her tit, her neck, and holding her face.\\n“God,” she moans. “When you go deep…”\\nI smile and lean back down, pumping her as I suck her neck and ear , and\\nthen her mouth.\\n“You like it?” I taunt.\\nShe nods. And then she grabs my waist, guiding me into her as she rolls\\nher hips to meet me.\\nFuck yes. That’ s it. Liquid heat courses down my body , and I thrust\\nharder and harder .\\n“Yes,” she pants, holding onto me as she arches up to kiss my neck.\\n“You feel so good. Don’ t stop.”  She layers her lips with mine, her breath\\nhot and wet. “Don’ t stop. Don’ t stop.”\\nThe nerves under my skin fire, and I feel her heat wrap me up as I push\\nher thighs up higher and drive into her . “Tiernan…”\\nI kiss her deep, licking her sweat, reveling in the heat inside the cab, and\\ntasting my life all those years ago when I would’ve died happy doing this to\\nsomeone for the rest of my life.\\nI look down at Tiernan, her body taking everything I’m giving, and I\\nswear I want to swallow her whole. I’d for gotten what this felt like.\\nTo actually want to make someone happy .\\nShe comes up, locks of her hair stuck to her face, and sinks her tongue\\ninto my mouth, her body tensing and shuddering as her moan drifts down\\nmy throat.\\nHer pussy contracts, and I know I don’ t have to hold it anymore.\\nShe lets out a cry, and I thrust, throwing my head back and driving into\\nher again and again, harder and harder .\\nHeat fills my groin, the blood rushes, and I come, spilling deep inside\\nher with one final thrust.\\nMy lungs empty , and I nearl y collapse, dropping my head to her\\nshoulder .\\n“Holy shit,” I murmur , breathing a mile a minute.\\nHer arms circle me, her thighs tightening around my waist, and I run my\\nhand up her leg, up her cute socks and hot thighs, over the curve of her ass, and up her torso.\\nLifting my head, I stare down at her .\\n“Don’ t talk,” she says right away . “You’ll ruin this. Feel guilty later .”\\nI laugh, kissing her forehead and her lips before bending down to take\\nher nipple in my mouth.\\n“I don’t want to leave,” I tell her, “but if we run out of gas, we’ll run out\\nof heat.”\\n“That’ s okay .” She arches her breast up into my mouth, moaning. “I’m\\nalready sweating.”\\nShe drags her nails up my back, and I kiss down her body  before\\nleaning back to look down at her .\\nShe glistens and glows, beautifully destroyed in the backseat of my\\ntruck.\\nSitting up, she spreads her thighs a little and slips a hand betw een her\\nlegs, trying to look down there like she’ s trying to see something.\\nI quirk a smile. “Expecting something to look dif ferent?”\\nShe smiles to herself, blushing a little.\\nThen, she looks up at me, her eyes wide. “Can we do it again?”\\nMy mouth falls open, and I’m fucking hard again.\\nJesus Christ.\\nHell yes. Fine. Whatever . The longer we stay in this truck, the longer I\\ncan put of f facing myself in the mirror .\\n“You ever ride a mechanical bull?” I ask her .\\nShe nods. “At a fair once.”\\nI sit back and pull her into my lap, so she straddles me. “This is just like\\nthat.”\\nAnd I kiss her , slipping inside her once again.  \\n \\n \\nJ a k e\\n \\nIt’s nineteen degrees, and I’m fucking sweating. I lift Tiernan into my arms,\\nher arms and legs wrapping around me as I walk us up the steps of the\\nhouse, our lips locked together , kissing as we make our way for the door .\\n“Don’ t fall,” she murmurs between kisses.\\n“I’m not gonna fall.”\\nJust then I slam my shin into a chair on the deck and stumble, grunting.\\nFuck.\\nWe tighten our arms around each other , but she laughs quietly anyway .\\nHer jeans are still open, her shirt barely buttoned, and mine’s not\\nbuttoned at all. It’s too fucking hot right now. We get to the door, and I heft\\nher up higher , looking up into her eyes. “You feeling bad about  any of this\\nyet?”\\nI don’ t mean physically , just… I don’ t know .\\nI’m too old. She’ s too young. This was a mistake.\\nBut I know damn well I’d make  it again given half the chance. It hasn’ t\\nbeen that good for me in a long time.\\nShe touches my face, her eyes gentle. “No,” she finally replies. “I’m\\nglad it was you.”\\nI stare up at her .\\nShe leans in, and I close my eyes as she kisses my forehead, my cheek,\\nand then my mouth. “Anyone else wouldn’ t have made it so perfect,” she\\ntells me. “You were gentle and slow and you made it feel good.” She tips\\nher forehead to mine. “I’m glad it was you.” My throat tighte ns, and I grab the back of her neck and bring her in,\\nkissing her. I still feel guilty , but… at least she doesn’ t, and I can only be\\ngrateful for now .\\nAnd part of what she says eases my nerves a bit. Assholes like Holcomb\\nwouldn’ t have cared to make sure she enjoyed it or someone her age\\nwouldn’ t have had much experience to know how to make  sure she enjoyed\\nit. I certainly didn’ t at eighteen. At least I could give her that.\\nBut was it special?\\nHer sweet mout h and taste and the heat between her legs warming my\\nstomach washes  over me, and I tighten my hold, feeling fucking high and\\nwanting to smile for the first time in forever . She feels like…\\nLike Flora did.\\nExcept with Tiernan, it feels easier somehow . Like I might not hurt her.\\nShe’s strong.\\n“This can’ t happen again, though,” I tell her .\\nShe nods, amusement in her eyes as she looks down at me. “Okay .”\\nBut her tone is too compliant. Like she doesn’ t believe me.\\n“I mean it,” I snip. “You’re going to college. Don’ t think abou t falling\\nin love with me.”\\n“I won’ t.”\\nShe’s not taking me seriously .\\n“We released some pent-up frustration, and hopefully I gave you a\\nworthy coming-of-age experience,” I say . “But that’ s it. It stops now .”\\n“Gotcha.”\\nBitch.\\nI paw for the door handle and lower her to her feet, both of us trying to\\nhold back our smiles. She knows she has months of cold, lonely nights to\\nambush me with her beautiful body .\\n“You got any more of those thigh-high socks?” I ask, throwing open the\\ndoor.\\n“What do you care?” she teases.\\nI chuckl e, both of us stepping into the house, but we see the boys sitting\\nin the living room ahead, immediately with turned heads and eyes on us.\\nOur laughter quiets, and we both stop, meeting their gazes.\\nNoah’ s eyes trail up and down me, and I realize again that my shirt is\\nopen, and her hair looks like it was caught in a hurricane.\\nShit. My smile falls. Kaleb sits in the chair by the fire, his eyes turned toward us, while Noah\\nwatches us over his shoulder , a sound like shuffling cards hittin g me, but I\\ncan’t see what’ s in his hands.\\nTiernan stif fens, looking up at me.\\n“Why don’ t you go on to bed?” I mumble to her .\\nShe nods, throws a glance in the boys’ direction, and heads up the stairs,\\nholding her shirt closed.\\nWithout meeting  the boys’ eyes again, I whip off my shirt and head\\nthrough the kitchen and into the shop, hearing them rise from their seats and\\nfollow me.\\nTurning on the faucet to the sink, I stick my head under the cold water ,\\nmy muscles and nerves relishing and relaxing under the icy bath.\\nThe water pours over my hair and cascades over my neck, and I swipe a\\nquick drink before I turn it of f and grab the towel of f the dryer .\\nI see Kaleb still on the stairs, leaning against the wall, while Noah\\nstands close, watching me.\\n“I fucked up,” I say , drying of f my face and neck.\\nWhat the hell is she going to think about all this in twenty years?\\n“I know I fucked up.”\\nNoah stands there like a wall, still as stone, but then he lashes out. He\\nthrows his arm, swiping everything of f the top of the dryer .\\nContainers and a laundry basket crash to the floor , and he picks up a\\npaint bucket and heaves it at the garage door. It bangs and hits the floor ,\\nteetering for a few seconds before it stops moving.\\nHe breathes hard. “And if I want her , too?”\\n“You don’t want her.” I shake  my head, tossing the towel. “You’re\\nlatching onto anything that will hold you here.”\\n“And you? You’re not going to marry her and keep her up here. Have\\nbabies and all that shit,” he barks. “She’ s leaving in the sprin g. Going to\\ncollege and moving on with her life. I might leave with her .”\\nI flex my jaw and step up to him, his eyes just a hair below mine. “I’m\\nnot sharing a woman with my sons.”\\n“How convenient,” he spits back. “After you took her away from us the\\nother night. W e had her first.”\\n“No, you didn’ t. The night of the last race when you both were upstairs\\nwith who-knows-who? We were down here in the kitchen. I had to…” I look away , shame warming my skin. “It didn’ t go far, but something started\\nthat night.”\\n“Kaleb had already been on her out here the night when he came home\\nfrom the cabin weeks ago,” Noah retorts.\\nWhat? I shoot my eyes up to Kaleb, his gaze slowly rising to meet mine.\\nYou’ve got to be kidding me.\\n“But you got her cherry , so…” Noah adds snidely .\\nI look at him hard. I know he’s right. They’d be a lot more suited to her\\nthan I would.\\nBut…\\n“I like her,” Noah says, his voice unusually gentle. “‘There are times\\nwhen I just want to be close to her .”\\nI meet his eyes.\\n“I’m not going to stop myself, unless she stops me,” he warns me.\\nAnd what am I supposed to say? ‘She’ s mine. Back off. You can’t take\\nher, because… why?’ Why can’ t he have her?\\nI’m not claiming her. She’ll leave, and this will end, because it has to.\\nI’m not taking her life from her and saddling her here.\\nI shouldn’ t have touched her .\\nSlowly , I start to nod. “Just act right,” I tell him. “She’ s free to make her\\nchoices. Y ou act right.”\\nA smile curls his lips, and he backs away , Kaleb and him disap pearing\\nback into the house.\\nIt’s only right, right? I didn’ t have any business fucking with her in the\\nfirst place. I don’t want her to think I don’t want her, but I don’t want her\\ngetting attached, either . It’s better to stop it sooner , rather than later .\\nI kick off my boots and head into the house, grabbing a beer from the\\nfridge as the boys watch TV as I pass by, catching Kaleb’ s eyes as I climb\\nthe stairs, him holding my gaze a lot longer than he ever does. The nice\\nthing about my oldest is his anger is never verbal. The bad thing is it\\nusually ends up in him disappearing into the mountains for weeks on end.\\nI’ll need to talk to him tomorrow . I don’t like it when he goes in the snow ,\\nbut he’ s always stupid enough to do exactly what he wants anyway .\\nNeither of my kids have ever wanted to stay with me, and after tonight,\\nI wouldn’ t blame them for hating me. They’re not going to marry her or fall\\nin love, either , but I had no right. I take a swig of my beer, heading to my room and seeing Tiernan’ s door\\nclosed, no light coming from under the door. She got in bed quick. She\\ndidn’ t hear our conversation, did she?\\nI strip off my clothes in the bedroom and pull on some flannel pants,\\nwashing up and brushing my teeth.\\nI should take a shower . I like the smell of her on my body , though.\\nRubbing the back of my neck, I try to walk for my bed. I’m tired, and\\ntomorrow will be another long day of custom work, chores, and repairs to\\nget ready for the next storm, whenever it hits.\\nBut I don’t go to my bed. Open ing my bedroom door, I head across the\\nhall to hers, and I knock. I just want to make sure she’s alright. If she’s\\ncrying, I’ll fucking kill myself.\\n“Come in,” she calls.\\nMy heart starts pumping harder . I open the door .\\nThe room is dark, lit only by the soft glow of the space heate r, and I\\nlean against the doorframe and find her in bed.\\nShe sits up, the blanket falling to her waist as she looks over at me.\\nI trail my eyes down her little white half shirt, my mouth going\\nsuddenly dry at the glimpse of her panties peeking out of the sheet.\\n“Showered?” I ask.\\nShe nods.\\nI can’t see her eyes very well, but when she straightens her spine,\\nstretching out her body and draw ing my eyes to her bare stomach, I feel my\\narms ache with the emptiness.\\n“Hungry?” I fight to keep my tone level.\\nShe shakes her head.\\nI take a swig of the beer , looking at her .\\n“Warm enough?”\\nShe cocks her head playfully . And she shakes it again.\\nI smile to myself, even through the sinking in my stomach.\\nI really wish I could’ve surprised myself and been stronger . I wish I\\nwasn’ t such a lousy piece of shit.\\nShe climbs out of bed and walks  over to me, taking the bottle out of my\\nhand and wrapping her arms around my neck so I can lift her up.\\nHer legs circle me like a belt, and I grip her ass.\\n“Wanna come into my bed tonight?” She buries her face in my neck and holds me tight, her breath and body\\nwarm and wanting on my skin.\\nGod, this feels good.\\nAnd I carry her into my bedroom, slamming the door and hiding us\\naway .\\nThis will end.\\nJust not tonight.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI wake with a start, my fingers aching as I slowly unclench them from the\\nsheet. I blink a few times, seeing the time on the clock come into view .\\n1:21.\\nThe room is dark, and I turn over onto my back, the cool air hitting my\\nbare breasts. I quickly pull the sheet up, covering myself as I remember\\neverything we just did a couple hours ago.\\nAnd in the truck yesterday .\\nI reach down, slipping my hand between my legs, the raw skin stinging\\na little and my thigh muscles aching.\\nI smile a little.\\nI’m glad it was him.\\nWhat I told him last night was true. No one’s first time is good, but\\nmine was. It hurt, but he was careful with me.\\nHe wasn’ t selfish or mean or impatient.\\nI look over, but he’s not in bed. I should probably get back to my own,\\nactually .\\nA light glows from the bathroom , and I sit up and slide my hand under\\nthe sheets, finding my panties and shirt. Swinging my legs over the side of\\nthe bed, I slip them both on and stand up, stretching. I wet my dry lips as I\\npull off the rubber band on my wrist and tie back my hair, walking for the\\nsink to get a glass of water .\\nBut as soon as I step into the bathroom, I see Jake standing in front of\\nthe mirror turned to the side, with his arm raised, and gazing at the tattoo on his hip.\\nMy Mexico.\\nHe catches my eyes in the mirror, and I drop mine, backing out of the\\nbathroom.\\n“Where are you going?” I hear him ask.\\nI stop and step back into view , but I just want to be gone now. Out of his\\nway.\\nI rub my eyes. “Just giving you your privacy ,” I mutter and make to\\nescape again.\\n“Why?”\\nI hesitate, shifting on my feet.\\nBecause…\\nYou didn’ t ask me to come in. I don’ t want to intrude.\\nBecause I know what this is.\\nAnd I’m not her .\\nHe stares at me through the mirror as he turns on the water and fills up a\\nglass.\\nWithout letting myself think, I walk over and press my forehead to his\\nback, close my eyes, and wrap my arms around his waist.\\nHe stills, letting me.\\nI don’t know why I do it, but the feel of him—of someone warm and\\nstrong—in my arms makes this weird feeling swell in my chest, and I lay\\nmy cheek against his spine, hearing his heart beat.\\nIt feels good to feel this. To be touched. To ask for what I need even if\\nhe wants me to leave. Just for a minute.\\nFinally , I sigh and pull away , but he catches my arms around his\\nstomach before I escape and tugs me back into place.\\n“Stay .”\\nMy chin trembles, my heart races, and tears fill my eyes.\\nI dip my head back into his back and try not to cry .\\nHe’s not my par ents.\\nHe’s not my parents.\\nHe wants me around.\\nIt’s okay .\\nI draw in a deep breath and release it slowly . It’s okay .\\nHe stands there silently , thankf ully not asking any fucking questions\\nabout why I’m almost crying again as I hug him. He just holds my arms in front of him, hanging onto me in a way .\\n“Are you thinking about her?” I ask.\\nBut he remains silent as he dumps out his water and sets the glass down.\\n“It’s okay if you are.”\\n“I’ve never really talked about her,” he says in almost a whis per, “to\\nanyone but you.”\\nI snake my hand back around his waist, breathing in the smell of his\\nskin. “What did she do that you liked?” I say .\\nHe inhales a deep breath and takes my hand, leading me over to the\\nshower .\\n“Her hands in my hair ,” he replies, turning on the shower .\\nHe tests the water and then turns  around, coming behind me and pulling\\nout my rubber band, so he can tie my hair up higher into a bun on the top of\\nmy head.\\nI grin at the gesture. Was he like this with her? Probably more so. If he’s\\nthis sweet with me, what was he like with a woman he loved?\\nI feel his finger s under the hem of my shirt, and I stop him, turning\\naround and shaking my head.\\nHolding his eyes, I peel back the curtain and step into the shower ,\\nletting the water soak me. His eyes fall down my body as the water trickles\\ndown my stomach and thighs, the white shirt and silk panties molding to\\nmy skin.\\nJust like she would’ve looked when they swam together .\\nI lean against the wall and watc h as he pushes his pants down his legs,\\nhis cock already stif f.\\nGod. Three times in the truck. Once in the bed. Apparently , I wasn’ t too\\nmuch for him to handle. Or vice versa.\\nHe closes the curtain, darkness  and steam filling the shower and our\\neyes still locked.\\nHe presses into me, but I keep my hands at my side.\\n“And what did you do then?” I ask. “After she ran her hands through\\nyour hair?”\\nHe lifts my leg, and I bite my lip as he pulls my wet panties to the side\\nand pushes inside of me.\\nI dig my nails into his arms, the pain and sting from being entered once\\nagain mixing with the pleasure of being filled. His mouth hovers over mine,\\nbreathing through his teeth as he pumps his dick. “Close your eyes,” I pant with his thrusting. “Make love to her .”\\nHe shuts his eyes, and I circle my arms around his neck, hangin g on as\\nhe lifts Flora into his arms and fucks her against the wall. I run my hand up\\nthe back of his head and over the top, threading my fingers through his hair,\\nrelishing the sweet ache deep inside.\\nI moan between  our kisses, the water on his mouth warm and sweet. I\\nclose my eyes, too, letting him go back. Letting him sink into the fantasy ,\\nbecause I want him to remember  how he loved her and know how lucky she\\nwas to have him. That it wasn’ t his fault.\\nThat my parents weren’ t his fault.\\nHe slide s in and out of me, grunting as I tip my head back and letting\\nhis mouth trail down my neck as I thread my fingers through his hair once\\nagain.\\n“I love you,” he murmurs. “But Tiernan uses her nails, and I like that\\nmore.”\\nButterflies rush through my stomach, and I tip my forehead to his,\\nimmediately curling my claws and dragging them lightly down the back of\\nhis head.\\n“Open your eyes, baby ,” he tells me.\\nI do, seeing him looking straight at me as the steam billows around us.\\n“I could never pretend you weren’ t you,” he says. “I don’ t want to.”\\nI hold his eyes, our bodies moving faster as his fingers dig into my ass.\\n“You remind me so much of her,” he whispers, not breaking his rhythm.\\n“I’m remembering things I haven’ t thought about in a long time.”\\nThe tip of his dick hits my spot, and I throw my head back and arch my\\nback, moaning.\\n“How possessive I was with her.” He grabs my face and brings me in,\\nkissing me. “I’d forgotten about that. How we fought a lot about the\\ndumbest stuf f. How thoughtless and impatient I was.”\\nWe fight about the dumbest stuff, too, but I don’t tell him that. If he\\nhadn’ t fought me, I wouldn’ t be any dif ferent now .\\nHe holds me, and I hold him, breathing hard against each other ’s lips.\\n“How overpowe ring the sex was,” he goes on, “because our emotions were\\nso much bigger than we were and we lost control. And how we were young\\nand fucked away every problem. I don’ t want that anymore.”\\n“What do you want?” I ask.\\nHe opens his mouth to speak, but nothing comes out. And then he lowers his voice, barely a whisper . “I want you to like\\nthis.”\\nI do.\\nBut before I have a chance to respond, he drops me to my feet, twists\\nme around, and pins me to the wall. I gasp as he spreads my legs and thrusts\\ninside of me again, pushing my body up on my tiptoes as he holds my thigh\\nwide with one hand. With the other , he reaches around and slips his hand\\ninside my panties.\\n“I want you happy , Tiernan,” he says low and husky in my ear. “I want\\nmy sons happy .”\\nHe fucks me up against the wall, thrusting faster and faster as I turn my\\nhead to meet his lips.\\n“And I want you to know that no matter where you go,” he tells me\\nbetween kisses, “you’ll always be ours. W e’re your home.”\\n“I know ,” I whimper .\\nForehead to forehead, we hold each other ’s eyes. “And I want you at my\\ntable in the morning and in my bed at night.”\\nI rock into the tiled wall, my breasts crushing against its surface, but I\\ndon’t care. I look over my shoulder , loving to watch him do this to me.\\n“Turns out that fucking prick did something right.” He pulls me back\\nagainst him, kissing me deep and pinching my nipple. “He gave you to us.\\nOur little princess. Ours. All ours.”\\nAnd that does it, the little sting of pain and his possessive words, and\\nI’m back ing up into him, hungry  to come. He grabs my hips, helping me as\\nwe both moan and cry out, my pussy clenching around him.\\n“We’ll wake them up,” I gasp out.\\nBut neither of us can stop.\\nMy orgasm crests, and I rub my clit as he hits deeps. “Oh, God, don’t\\nstop,” I beg. “Don’ t stop.”\\n“Fuck,” he growls. “Fuck.”\\nHe pounds harder and harder , and I slam my hands into the wall, crying\\nout one more time as my entire body comes apart, a burst of tingles\\nexploding under my skin.\\nI breathe hard, whimpering as he falls into me, still squeezing my thighs\\nin his hands.\\n“Fuck,” he whispers, out of breath. “We should….” His chest rises and\\nfalls against my back. “We should probably use condoms, I think. Even if you are on the pill, this is too much to risk it.”\\nI nod, too tired to argue. He’s probably right. Five times in twelve hours\\nwon’ t be a daily thing, I’m sure, but the more it happens, the bigger the\\nchance.\\nHe lifts up. “Even if this is the hottest thing I’ve ever seen,” he adds as\\nhe rubs his thumb across my inner thigh. I blush, feeling him seep out of\\nme. I don’ t know what it looks like, but I like how it feels.\\nI peel off my clothes, wring them out, and rinse myself off, both of us\\nclimbing out of the shower and drying of f.\\nI go into his room and pull out a pair of his blue boxer shorts, rolling\\nthem up a few times to make them fit, and one of his T-shirts. I need\\nsomething dry to wear between here and my room.\\nI take my wet clothes and give him a peck on the cheek.\\nHe pauses in the middle of pulling on a shirt. “What are you doing?”\\n“Going back to bed,” I reply . “While I still have my legs under me.”\\nHe cocks an eyebrow , but I see the smile he tries to bite back.\\nSeriously , though. I need actual sleep.\\nAnd space. Too much too fast makes me a little afraid. I like what I\\nfound here. I don’ t want to lose myself again.\\n“See you tomorrow night,” I whisper as I come in and kiss him again,\\nthis time on the lips.\\n“Tomorrow night,” he replies.\\nI turn to leave, but then I stop and ask, “Do I have to still be up for\\nmorning chores?”\\nHe narrows his eyes in confusion.\\n“I mean, since mine go later at night now?”\\nHis eyes go round, and he bares his teeth, whipping out his hand and\\nsmacking me on the ass.\\nI laugh and rush out the door , closing it behind me.\\nBut not before I catch his smile as he shakes his head.\\nI like his smile. We so rarely get to see it. I blow out a breath and make\\nmy way to my room, but a scent suddenly hits me, and I stop, looking to my\\nright.\\nThere, in the narrow , dark stairwell leading up to the third floor , an\\norange ember burns bright and a cloud of smoke drifts out from the black.\\nMy smile falls. Kaleb. I glance  at Jake’ s door, gaugi ng his bedroom is well within\\nearshot of the stairwell. How long has Kaleb been sitting there?\\nHe moves, the floorboards creak ing as he stands up, and I straighten as\\nhe emer ges from the darkness, staring at me as he takes anoth er drag and\\nthen drops the butt to the floor , stepping on it with his bare foot.\\nMy stomach coils, and I shoot my eyes up to meet his again.\\n“What?” I ask.\\nBut of course, he remains silent.\\nHe walks toward me, and I move, backing up to my room, but he shoots\\nout his hand and blocks me. I hit the wall, dropping my wet clothes as he\\ncomes in close, bearing down.\\nShit. So what is he thinking? We’ll go out to the shop and finish what he\\nstarted weeks ago? I’ll be easy now?\\nHis warm body and bare chest hover close, and I turn my face away ,\\nalmost shivering at his hot breath on my cheek.\\nBending down, he picks up my red panties that are still damp from the\\nshower , and stands back up, rubbing the material between his fingers as he\\nstares at them.\\nA moment of guilt hits me, but I don’ t know why .\\nI grab for the underwear , but he yanks them away , and my stomach\\nhardens like a wall of bricks. I slap him.\\nHe jerks a little but doesn’ t falter .\\nI grab for the panties again, but the fabric tears as he pulls his arm away .\\nHe balls  my underwear in his hand, his eyes angry and on fire as he slams\\nthe fist into the wall by my head. I suck in a breath, cowering on reflex.\\nWhat did I do? Like he actually cares.\\nEverything I felt a moment ago with Jake is gone. I straighten, ready to\\nshove his son of f me, but before I have a chance, Kaleb grabs me.\\nTaking me by the arms, he backs me up into my room and pushes me\\ndown on the bed, pinning me there.\\n“Get of f,” I growl, fighting his arms, but he’ s quick to keep hold.\\nHe rears up a little, and I barely  have a moment for realization to dawn\\nbefore I turn away and squeeze my eyes shut, his spit landing in my hair .\\nTears immediately spring to my eyes, and my chest swells with a cry .\\nHe grabs something off my nightstand, and when he drags it across my\\nforehead, I realize it’ s my marker . He quickly climbs of f me, tosses the Sharpie, and I lie there, too stunned\\nto move for a moment.\\nI don’ t have to look in the mirror to know what he wrote.\\nHe leaves the room, his footfal ls heavy on the stairs to the attic, and\\nwhen I hear his door slam shut, I finally sit up.\\nTears hang in my eyes, but I’m not crying anymore.\\nI stare of f, angry and feeling dirty all of a sudden.\\nBut after a moment, the shame turns to more rage, and I almost smile.\\nHe’s pissed.\\nI’m almost amused.\\nHe’s had at least three women  in his room since I’ve been here, not\\ncounting Cici in the barn that day. But I’m the slut who gets spat on. Would\\nI have still been one if I’d let him and Noah share me that night last week?\\nHis fucking spit weighs in my hair, and it’s all I feel. The anger building\\nin my lungs with every breath is almost enough to drown out the ache.\\nOurs , Jake had said.  All ours.\\nBut in the quiet of my room, the dull thrum of Kaleb’ s music vibrating\\noverhead, I shake my head.\\n“Yours,” I murmur . “Not his.”\\n \\n \\n“No laptops at the table,” Jake says at breakfast.\\nHe picks up my computer , and I grab my notebook and pencil off it just\\nin time so it won’ t tumble to the floor . “This assignment is due.” I argue.\\n“I’ve been tryin g to send it for an hour now, but the Internet keeps going\\nout.”\\n“They’ll underst and.” He closes the top and sets it on the counter . “Try\\nagain later .”\\nI frown, but I toss my notebook and pen on the counter with the\\ncomputer , giving in. I was on a roll. I’ve never had trouble being motivated\\nfor homework until now. You wouldn’ t think a remote little place tucked\\naway in secluded little Chapel Peak, Colorado, would provide so many\\ndistractions, but I constantly want to be doing a million other things.\\nPetting the animals.\\nMaking treats for the animals.\\nPlaying with the animals. I glance at Jake as he doles out oatmeal into my bowl. Tucked away\\nsomewher e quiet with one animal in particular .\\nHe must  sense me watching, because he shoots his eyes over, meeting\\nmine as he pours heaping scoops into the boys’ bowls. I spot the slight curl\\nof a smile, because he knows exactly what I’m thinking, but he quickly\\nhides it again as he drops the ladle back into the pot.\\nI tuck my grin between my teeth, picking up my spoon.\\nBoth boys walk in, Noah shiveri ng as he slips off his coat and sits down\\nat the table, while Kaleb heads to the sink, washing his hands. I look out the\\nwindow .\\nThere’ s no glow of the sun that’s usually hitting the deck by now, and I\\ncan’t smell the barn on their clothes—the hay and the animals—that’ s\\nusually so pungent. It’ s too cold.\\n“How many inches are we expe cting tonight?” I ask, knowing without\\nlooking at the weather that it’ s going to snow .\\nNoah lets out a chuckle as if I just told a joke, and Jake stops dead,\\ncocking his head, and throwing him a look.\\nAnd then it occurs to me. Inches. I roll my eyes and sprinkle some\\nbrown sugar on my oatmeal. Idiot.\\nHe looks at his father , holding up his hands in defense. “I would’ve\\nmade that joke no matter what.”\\nKaleb pulls out the chair across  from me and starts to eat, and I watch\\nhim for a moment, almost hoping he meets my eyes. My forehead still\\nstings from all the scrubbing it took to get that Sharpie of f.\\nBut he doesn’ t look. Again, I’m not even here.\\nI drop my gaze and stick a spoonful in my mouth. I should tell Jake\\nwhat happened last night after I left his room, but that wouldn’ t hurt Kaleb.\\nHe doesn’ t care what anyone thinks, and Jake can’t control him. The most\\nannoying thing I can do to Kaleb is to keep doing exactly what I’ve been\\ndoing.\\nI stick another bite in my mouth and look back down at my copy of\\nBeloved , turning the page.\\n“Have you ever seen snow before?” I hear Noah ask. “Oh, never mind.\\nMy mistake. Y ou’re totally a Swiss Alps girl.”\\n“French, thank you,” I say without looking up from my book.\\nI take a bite, remembering the last time I skied. Another activity I could\\ndo alone, so I loved it. Winter and snow don’t suck if you’re having fun in it.\\nI look up again. “Yes, I’ve seen it,” I tell Noah, joking aside. “I haven’ t\\nplayed in it much, though. Or driven in it or lived in it. But I have seen The\\nShining , and I do know  what happens to people cooped up at a remote\\nlocation through a long winter in Colorado. It can be quite deadly .”\\nHe chuckles, and I look back down at my food, but catch Kaleb’ s eyes\\nand stop for a moment. He watches me, his body still and his hot, green\\neyes hard on me.\\nI clear my throat.\\n“All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” Noah jabs me in the ribs,\\nteasing.\\nI squirm away in my seat. “Stop it.”\\n“All play and no work means I got a new toy,” he sing-songs and slides\\nhis chair over to mine, tickling me harder .\\n“Noah, stop!” I protest, but I giggle anyway as I squirm in his arms.\\nI’ve never been tickled before coming here, and I don’ t like it.\\nBut I can’ t stop laughing.\\nI shake my head and kick him under the table, the silverware clanking.\\nI’m dying to hit him, but I’m too busy trying to twist away from his fingers\\nas I tear up through the laughter .\\n“Hands of f,” I hear Jake chide. “Now .”\\nBut Noah doesn’ t listen.\\nHe bring s his hand up under my neck, and I go to bite it, but he pulls it\\naway . I jab him back, tickling him, too, and we push back our chairs, the\\nlegs scraping against the tile as I start to fight back.\\nWhen I was little, my parents’ friends had a daughter who invite d me to\\nher birth day sleepover—because of who my parents were and not because\\nwe were  friends—but I remember seeing the dad wrestling with his toddler\\non the floor that night. They laughed and played, rolled around  and he let\\nthe little boy tickle him back. It was such a weird thing to see. Families who\\nplayed together .\\nI dart out for his glass, ready to threaten him with a little shower , but\\nbefore I can take it, Kaleb shoves his bowl, hitting the pot in the middle of\\nthe table.\\nIt slams into my cup of milk, making my drink topple over, hit the table,\\nand spill across the top. I can’t make it out of the way before it spills over\\nthe side and right into my lap. I shove my chair back, my bare thighs and sleep shorts already soaked\\nas I dart my eyes up to Kaleb.\\n“Shit,” Noah mumbles, and I see him get up, hopefully to grab a dish\\ntowel as Jake shoots his eyes over to Kaleb.\\nI clench my jaw .\\nSpoke too soon. Not everyone in this family plays together , I guess, and\\nsomeone certainly isn’ t in the mood. I look up, meeting Kaleb’ s eyes.\\nHe stares at me across the table, the kitchen now silent, and if there was\\nany doubt abou t whether or not that was deliberate, there isn’t now. The\\ncold milk streams down my thighs and drips to the floor , and Jake stares\\ndown at him, breathing hard.\\nNoah tosses a towel into my lap and takes another , quickly wiping up\\nthe mess. Kaleb and I are still locked in a stare.\\nHe’s all over me one minute. Can’t stand me the next. Pulls me into his\\nlap, so I don’t get soda all over my clothes, and then turns around and\\ndouses me.\\nSliding my fingers under my sweater , I hold Kaleb’ s eyes as I pull down\\nmy shorts and slip them off my legs. My top hangs just below my ass, and I\\ncock my head, watching his gaze falter as he drops it to my legs for a\\nmoment. I’m staying here. He’s not making me run. Or cry. He might not\\nlike someone new in the house—or a girl in the house—but I didn’ t ask for\\nthis, either .\\nI sit there, showing him that he won’ t make me run and hide anymore,\\nand when he relaxes back into his chair , the tension in his muscles\\nunderneath his shirt easing, I think I finally have.\\nBut then I watch as he slides his spoon into his bowl of oatmeal and lifts\\nit up, facing me instead of putting it into his mouth.\\n“Kaleb, no.” Jake moves for him.\\nBut he flings the tip of the utensil, the glob of oatmeal on the end\\nlaunching acros s the table. I jerk my face to the side, squeezing my eyes\\nshut just in time for it to land across my jaw, the warm goo splattering\\nacross my face.\\n“Goddammit!” Jake barks and rises, reaching for Kaleb.\\nBut I interject, swallowing the ache in my chest. “It’ s okay .”\\n“What the hell is the matter with you?” Jake yells at him, fisting his\\nshirt. “It’s okay ,” I say louder , letting the mess stick to my skin and not\\nmaking any move to clean it.\\nBut Noah scolds him. “Kaleb…”\\nJake pulls Kaleb to his feet.\\n“Stop!” I blurt out. “It’ s okay .”\\nJake darts his eyes over his shoulder to me. “It’ s not okay .”\\n“It’s how babies communicate,” I explain.\\nHe narrows his eyes, and I look to Kaleb, lifting my chin an inch.\\n“Right?” I taunt him. “They throw things, because they can’t use their\\nwords.” I pick a glob off my face and whip it into my bowl. “Did you want\\nmore? Is that what you’re trying to tell me, Kaleb?”\\nI pinch the fingers of each hand together and bob the tips of my right\\nhand and left hand together . “Like this,” I instruct him. “More.”\\nLike babies who learn sign language to communicate before they can\\ntalk. Except Kaleb can talk. And write and sign. I used to think he just\\ndidn’ t want to communicate, but no. He has no trouble communicating.\\n“Can you do that?” I ask him, making my voice light and sugary like\\nI’m talking to a child. “Mooooore.”\\nHe growls, throws his father off, and grabs the table, flipping it over. I\\ngasp, watching the table crash to the floor on its side, everything on top\\nspilling to the tile. Dishes break, the oatmeal in the pot splatter s across the\\nrefrigerator , and Noah’ s juice hits Jake’ s jeans before shattering on the floor .\\nI can’t tell what’ s happening on Jake’ s or Noah’ s faces, but I don’t move\\nas I try to hide how my heart hammers in my chest.\\nI look up at Kaleb and almost smile, despite the fear. He’s losing his\\nmind.\\nAnd he’ s mean.\\nDid I just win and now he’ll stop?\\nOr did I make it worse and now I have to wait for him to strike again?\\nBefore anyone moves, he’s gone. Spinning around, he walks out of the\\nkitchen, and I hear the door open and slam shut as he leaves the house.\\nUnfortunately , he can’ t go far , though.\\nJake starts to follow him, but I call out. “Stop.”\\nIt’s between Kaleb and me.\\nJake turns, regar ding me for a minute. “What the hell is going on? He’s\\nnever acted like that.”\\nI kind of feel a pang of pride at hearing that. But I just shrug my shoulders and stand up, my long sweatshirt covering\\nmy underwear as I reach for the paper towels to clean myse lf up. “Just\\nplaying.”\\n \\n \\nPoor Noah got stuck cleaning up the kitchen, because Jake went out looking\\nfor his son only to find that Kaleb had taken the snowmobile out hunting.\\nGood. I hope he is gone all day .\\nHell, hunting can take multiple days. And since we just bagged a buck\\nyesterday , we don’t need the meat, which means he wants to be gone as\\nmuch as I want him gone.\\nI don’t understand him. I wanted to, but he’s like an animal. He eats. He\\nmates. He fights. That’ s it.\\nHe can’t be jealous. He didn’ t seem angry when Noah was on top of me\\nthe other night.\\nNoah.  I drop my eyes.\\nAnd Jake.\\nMy cheeks warm, and the guilt I’ve been pushing away creeps in again.\\nI’ll never not understand why it happened with Jake. Or why it could’ve\\nhappened with Noah. Somethi ng about this house—these people—lend\\ncredence every day to what I always knew I needed. Not sex. Not a guy .\\nJust a place. Somewhere or someone to feel like home.\\nAnd yesterday , Jake Van der Berg needed that just as much as me. I\\nguess I feel guilty , because others won’ t understand it. They’ll have\\nopinions, but the great thing is they’ll probably never find out. Mirai’ s not\\nhere. Strangers with smartphones aren’ t here. TMZ’ s not here.\\nWe’re free.\\nI spend the rest of the morning catching up on school work and finally\\ngetting it submi tted online when I can catch a signal, and then I bundle up\\nin my coat, boots, gloves, and hat and step outside. A sprinkle of snow falls,\\nlittle wet flakes hitting my face as I close the door, and I stop,  tipping my\\nface up to the cloudy sky .\\nI love this. The air seeps into my pores and caresses my face, making\\nthe loose hairs peeking out of my hat float and flit in the breeze. For a\\nmoment, everything is quiet, except for the sound of the snowflakes hitting\\nthe twelve inches of beautiful, untouched blanket on the deck. Snowfall isn’t like rainfall. Rain is passion. It’s a scream. It’s my hair\\nsticking to my face as I wrap my arms around him. It’ s spontaneous, and it’ s\\nloud.\\nSnowfall is like a secret. It’s whispers and firelight and searching for his\\nwarmth between the sheets at two a.m. when the rest of the house is asleep.\\nIt’s holding him tightly and loving him slowly .\\nI open my eyes, breathing out a puff of steam into the air and watching\\nit dissipate.\\nThe cordless screwdriver whirs in the shop, and I take a step, the snow\\npacking under my feet as I head down the stairs. Noah and Jake work away\\nbehind the closed doors, and I walk past the shop, kind of wishing they’d let\\nme go for a hike by myself.\\nBut I get it. The wilderness is dangerous enough, and I’m a rookie in the\\nsnow .\\nStepping into the stable, I walk for Shawnee, such a beautiful bay mare\\nwith a red-brown body and black legs, eyes, and a mane. Even the tips of\\nher ears are black. She looks like a fox, and I can tell she’s plotting her next\\nescape.\\n“Hey .” I grin and reach into my pocket, pulling out the plastic tube\\nfilled with her favorite treat. Tearing it open with my teeth, I push the\\nfrozen fruit juice up and out of the wrapping and break it off, feeding it to\\nher with my hand. Her muzzle digs into my palm, grabbing hold of the\\nflavored ice, and I come in closer as her head hangs over the door to her\\nstall. I break off another piece and then another , feeding her the rest. As she\\nchews and chews, I take off my glove and rub my hand up and down her\\nsnout and then up to her forehead.\\n“You keeping warm?” I ask, rubbing her all over the head and nuzzling\\nmy own into her. It’s amazing how warm she actually is. Jake blankets the\\nolder horses at night, but he doesn’t want to baby Shawnee. She gets more\\nthan enough hay, and he assure s me she’s acclimated to the frigid winter\\ntemps as long as she doesn’ t get her winter coat wet. And so far, so good. I\\nguess it’s all relative. A forty-de gree day feels better than a nineteen-degree\\nday, but a nineteen-degree day feels a hell of a lot warmer than ten below ,\\ntoo.\\nI give her a half-smile. “Reality  is fickle, isn’t it?” I ask. “We can get\\nused to almost anything.” We all acclimate . We learn, we resolve, we come around—it’ s not that\\nanything really gets easier or harder. We just get better at rolling with it. I’m\\nnot sure these men will be different because of me, but I’ll be different\\nbecause of them. I like that.\\nAnd I don’ t.\\nI pull out another juice pop, and Shawnee immediately stomps her\\nhooves and bobs her head. I smile, tearing open the tube. There’ s so much I\\nlove about my days now .\\nI finish feeding and tending to everyone, making sure the three horses\\nhave plenty of hay and water , and then I put my glove back on and roam\\ninto the barn from the stable. Noah left the buckets I need in here.\\nI check every corner , behind bales of hay , and all the hooks on the walls,\\nbut I don’t see anything. Stoppi ng, I absently shake my head. How does he\\nlose stuf f so easily?\\nBut as I start to head out, a loud thud hits my ears, and I jump. I thought\\nthey were in the shop.\\nThree more pounding sounds hit, and I peer around the stalls, not seeing\\nanything or anyone. What…\\nForgetting the buckets, I veer left and head down the row of stalls, the\\nsound getting louder the closer I get to the door. Another thud hits, and I\\nblink, slowly reaching out and laying my palm against the door. It doesn’ t\\nlatch, and even though I see movement behind the cracks and I know who it\\nis, I push the door wide anyway , the hinges whining as the room beyond\\ncomes into view .\\nA large stove burns in the corne r of the dark room, fire spitting from its\\nvents as Kaleb stands at a table with his back to me. He raises his ax,\\ncoming down hard. Blood splat ters, he removes the leg, and then he grabs\\nhis hunting knife. A lump rises in my throat, and I can’ t breathe.\\nOh, God.\\nI rear back, but I don’t escape in time. The sounds as he tears into the\\nhide of whateve r animal he bagged, the serrated edge carving through the\\nskin, muscle, and rib cage, hits my ears as blood immediately spills at his\\nfeet.\\nI swallow the bile down.\\nHe turns, seeing me, and his green eyes hold me frozen as he raises his\\nfingers. Sweat covers his chest and arms, his hair sticking to his temples, and I watch as a small grin curls his lips, and he sticks a finger into his\\nmouth, licking the blood of f.\\nHe grips the knife in his other hand, lowering his chin and looking at me\\nas if nothing else exists in the world, and there’ s no way they’d hear me out\\nhere beyond the machines they’re running in the shop if I screamed.\\nYeah, no.\\nI grab the door and pull it closed as I scurry back out of the room. His\\nlight chuckle carries as I quickly disappear from his sight. Asshole.\\nBut then I stop, noticing. He laughed. Out loud.\\nIt wasn’ t much, but I heard his deep voice. He’s growled or grunted a\\nfew times, but he let me hear him laugh. I narrow my eyes, lost in thought. I\\nwonder if he even realizes.\\nHe let me hear him.\\nI shrug, shaking it off, and take a step toward the exit. But then\\nsomething catch es my eye, and I look to my right, noticing a ladder . I’m not\\nin the barn much, especially since this is where Kaleb likes to lurk.\\nGlancing at the door again, behind which he still works, I approach the\\nladder , placing my boot on the bottom rung and gripping the one level with\\nmy head.\\nI climb, coming up through a door in the floor and stand up in a small\\nroom, filled with sheet-covered objects.\\nFurniture?\\nI reach out, grab one of the pieces of cloth and pull.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\n“What do you want to do with it?” Jake asks me.\\nHe and Noah each hold a side as they carry the three-drawer chest into\\nthe shop, and I smile at the feather -and-filigree carvings in the wood.\\n“Anything you’l l let me, I guess.” I shrug, not really knowing yet. “It’s\\na great piece of furniture, and there’ s so much more up there.”\\nThere were more chests, a couple of dressers, some end tables and a\\nbedside table, a couple of doors , and a desk. None of the furniture was in\\ngood shape, but as soon as I saw it all, my heart leaped. Everything in our\\nhouse growing up was so new .\\nI walk over, running my hand over the grainy wooden top of the chest.\\nThere’ s no history in new . No mystery . I like old.\\nJake stands back, looking at the piece with me. It almost looks like\\nsomething out of Beauty and the Beast . The Disney version. The wood\\ncurves, the chest widening as it goes up, and there’ s lots of detai l around the\\nedges and feet. This was probably a stunning piece in its day .\\n“My ex and I collected a bunch of stuff from yard sales for when we\\nfinished building this place,” Jake says, “but then shit happened, so…”\\nI open the drawers, checking the functionality .\\n“So yeah, it’s all yours,” he adds. “It’s one other thing to keep you\\noccupied this winter .”\\nI turn my head over my shoulder , shooting him a look.\\nOne other  thing.\\nHe smirks. Noah nudges my arm. “Let me show you the paints.”\\nI follow him.\\n \\n \\nHours later, Noah and I work away in the shop, our empty dinner bowls of\\nJake’ s chili sitting on the ceme nt floor . The wind howls outside the bay\\ndoor, but the wood-burning stove crackles in the background, and I don’t\\neven need a coat out here.\\nAlthough, I’m wearing two pairs of cozy socks inside my slipper clogs\\nas I putter around in my jeans and Noah’ s flannel.\\nPushing up my sleeves, I dip the rag in the turpentine and bring it up,\\nslopping it across the top of the chest and scrubbing off the remnants of the\\nfinish.\\n“Doing okay?” Noah asks.\\nI look up, seeing him digging in a coffee can, the nuts and bolts inside\\njingling.\\n“Yeah.”\\n“What’ s the sudden interest in furniture rehab?”\\nI laugh under my breath, sloshing the rag into the can again. “Maybe it’s\\nan excuse to be where you guys are,” I tease. “All of us working together .”\\nHis white teeth peek out as his smile spreads.\\n“Or maybe I just don’t want to be left alone inside with your brother ’s\\nwrath,” I mumble.\\nI’d had to wash my hair after the oatmeal this morning. Kaleb helped\\nwith the bikes sometimes, but I caught on very early that Jake didn’ t make\\nthe same demands of him that he did with Noah. Probably because he\\ncouldn’ t push Kaleb around and didn’ t want to risk pushing him too far .\\nSometimes Kaleb helped here in the shop. And sometimes he took care\\nof the animals, chopped wood , repaired various equipment around the\\nproperty , hunted , played with the dogs, or shut himself up in his room. He\\ndidn’ t stick to only things he wanted to do, but it usually had to be things\\nwhere he could be left alone. I knew that much.\\nI continu e, my two low pigtails  bobbing against my chest as I rub the\\nwood down to its natural color .\\nMaybe it’ s an excuse to be wher e you guys ar e. I might not have been joking about that. College brochures and course\\ncatalogs sit on the kitchen table right now, because as soon as I sat down\\nearlier with my laptop to try to go online to fill out applications , I suddenly\\nneeded air . Every university takes me away from here.\\n“It’s not personal, you know?” Noah says.\\nI look up at him.\\n“Kaleb,” he clarifies.\\nI drop my eyes, focusing back on my work. I find that hard to believe.\\nDoes he spit in most people’ s hair? Noah doesn’ t know everything.\\nTossing the cloth back in the can, I walk to the basin and wash my\\nhands. Noah crouches down to lie on his back, sliding under the bike again.\\n“Don’ t you want to know what happened to him?” he asks.\\n“If he wants to tell me.”\\nI actually am interested, but my pride won’ t allow me to show it.\\nI whip my hands, flinging the excess water before turning of f the faucet.\\n“He’ s like our father .” Noah twists a wrench, looking up at his work.\\n“They don’ t trust women. Until you, anyway .”\\nTrust me how? And wanna bet it was one woman who ruined it for all\\nof us? How original. And not at all silly .\\nNoah tosses his tool, and I see the black all over his fingers. “Hand me\\nthat wrench with the yellow tape on it, would you?”\\nI head over to his worktable and grab the long silver tool with a black\\nhandle and yello w tape. Walking over to him, I drop down and slide under\\nthe bike with him.\\n“And you?” I ask, handing him the wrench. “Do you trust me?”\\nHe uses the tool, tightening or loosening something, not making eye\\ncontact. I’m still not sure what that means, though. Trust me to have their\\nbacks? Not hurt them? Be faithful? Never abandon them?\\nHe’s silent for a few more moments, and the seconds start to stretch as\\nthe dread inside me churns.\\n“I heard you last night,” he says in almost a whisper .\\nHeard me…\\nHis tight lips purse as he tightens the bolt. “Daddy didn’ t love you, so\\nyou let mine fuck you so he will.”\\nI stare hard at him as he works, and even though his anger rocks me,\\nbecause this is Noah and Noah is always my friend, his words don’t\\nnecessarily hurt. He needs to say something. He goes on. “Maybe you’ve done without for so long, you’re confused\\nthat sex means love.”\\nHe hands me the wrench, and I take it.\\n“Maybe you’ll do anything to make sure he never forgets you exist,” he\\nnearly whispers. “Even if it means spreading your pretty legs.”\\nThe jaw of his smooth, tanned face flexes, and he still won’ t meet my\\neyes, but even though his sharp words try to cut, I’m not mad.\\nHe frowns, and I can tell the wheels are turning in his head.\\n“Or maybe…” he says. “Maybe you’re like me, and you’ll do anything\\nto feel good.” He finally turns his eyes to look at me. “Even if it means\\nnever remembering their last names.”\\nI hold his gaze, both of us lying on our backs and Jake and Kaleb\\nsomewhere in the house.\\nThe flecks of green in his blue eyes darken, and I’m almost at ease until\\nI see his stare harden on me.\\n“I wanted to be in there with you,” he whispers.\\nThe dark space under the bike hides us from the door, and I don’t run\\naway , because I’m not scared of Noah.\\nAnd I am scared of him. I like that he talks to me.\\nBut sometimes I’m afraid of it, too.\\n“They don’t talk to me, either ,” he murmurs. “I was going to make love\\nto you, you know?”\\nMy gaze falters. He says it like he’ s never done it before.\\n“I was going to make love to you,” he repeats.\\nAnd I finally get it.\\nNot screw . Not fuck.\\nHe was going to make it matter .\\nHis chest rises and falls, and even though I know I have a warm bed\\ninside filled with a man who holds me so tight and will never not care for\\nme, I…\\nI want to see Noah.\\nI want to hear him.\\n“Talk to me,” he says.\\n“What do you want me to say?”\\nHe hesit ates, his baseball cap sitting backward on his head as I watch\\nhis lips softly start to move. “Did you like watching me on the couch the other night?” he asks in a\\nlow voice.\\nI search his eyes, fear holding me back but desire keeping me planted.\\n“How far would we have gone if he hadn’ t come in?” he presses.\\nI breathe in and out, holding his eyes, and all of a sudden we’re back on\\nthe couch. The space is small, the air is thick, something is happening, and\\nwe don’t know what or if we should, but we know we don’t want to stop\\nyet.\\nHe reaches down, but I don’t look to see what he’s doing. Instea d, I hear\\nhis belt buckle jingle, and his zipper open. His eyes search mine, probably\\nwondering if I’m going to flee. Or waiting for me to flee.\\nBut I don’t. Not as he reaches inside his jeans and not as I watch him\\nstroke himself out of the corner of my eye.\\n“How far?” he ur ges.\\nHow far was I going to let him and Kaleb go that night? Would I have\\nlet them take turns? Or would we have gone to a bed and would I have let\\nthem have me at the same time? W e’ll never know , but I do know one thing.\\n“I wasn’t going to stop,” I tell him. I turn on my side, tucking my hands\\nunder my cheek as I look over at him. “I just wanted to let go and have the\\nmoment. Even if you were using me to feel good, because I wanted to feel\\ngood, too.”\\nHe nods slowly . “Sucks, doesn’ t it?” A beautiful smile plays across his\\nlips. “Craving that fucking escape so badly , because someone else left you\\nempty?”\\nI move in, placing my hand on his chest as my nose brushes his cheek.\\n“Nothing about you is empty ,” I whisper . “I can feel your heart.”\\nIt beats against my hand, and I close my eyes, feeling his warm body\\nmove and thinking about what he would feel like. How he would’ve felt\\nthat night we were interrupted.\\nIt wasn’ t just an escape, Noah.  It wasn’ t. It was a connection.\\nA connection I feel with him probably stronger than anyone here. No\\none loved him enough. Jake’ s respect has been too hard to earn, and Kaleb\\ndoesn’ t talk to him. Like me, Noah doesn’ t have a place he belongs. He gets\\neverything I’m feeling, he sees what I see, and he knows what I walk\\naround with, because even though he’s not alone, he’s lonely . He didn’ t\\nhave anyone to talk to here, and just like my parents’ house wasn’ t a home,\\nneither is the peak for him. He doesn’ t feel good here. Until maybe now .\\nHe quickens his pace, and I open my eyes, looking down at his hand,\\nmoving inside his jeans. My clit throbs despite myself, and the warmth\\nbetween my legs aches.\\n“Noah…” I breathe out, begging him. “Go slower . I like watching you. I\\nlike it slow .”\\nHe turns his face toward me, our lips brushing each other . “Tiernan…”\\nI lick my lips. “T ake your pants down more.”\\nHe bends his knees up and pushes his jeans and boxers down.\\nHe pulls out his cock, thick and hard, and I watch him rub his thumb\\nover the wet tip and continue stroking it. I know he’s watching me as I\\nwatch him, but I don’ t care.\\nSomeone—maybe me—straddles him, and I see it in my head. He\\nmakes love to her from the bottom, pumping his hips up into her .\\nSlowly , I unbutton his shirt with one hand. I spread the shirt open, his\\nnaked skin from  his neck down to his groin waiting for me. My fingers hum\\nwith desire. I want to touch him.\\nBut I don’ t.\\n“Slower ,” I tell him. I don’ t want him to come yet.\\n“Open your shirt.”\\nI meet his eyes.\\n“He won’ t see,” Noah murmurs. “Open your shirt for me.”\\nI falter , the pulse in my neck throbbing. I want to.\\nI…\\n“He won’ t find out,” Noah says, tossing a look behind me toward the\\ndoor to the kitchen.\\nWhat would happen if he did? At any second that door could open.\\n“Open,” Noah growls under his breath. “Y our fucking shirt, princess.”\\nI reach up, holding his eyes as he jerks himself and unbutton his shirt\\nthat I wear . Underneath, I sport a tight, tank top, and he doesn’ t even ask.\\nHe bares his teeth, yanking it up over my breasts. His lungs empty as he\\nstares at my body , and I lie on my back again, letting him drink me in.\\nMy nipples harden, sharpening to points in the chilly air . “Noah…”\\nHe licks the palm of his hand, dragging his tongue over it, and dipping\\nback down to jerk himself harder , his eyes never leaving my body .\\nHe fists his hard cock, cum dripping from its tip. He inches in to touch\\nme, and I shake my head. No.\\nHe stops, his angry eyes zoning in on me.\\n“No one says no to me,” he whispers.\\nI smile a little.\\n“I want my mouth all over your body ,” he says, staring at my breasts.\\n“Let me taste them.”\\nI shake my head again, but my skin tingles with the idea. His mouth\\nhungrily sucking on me… God.\\nHe makes me feel powerful. With Noah, I’m not embarrassed to\\ndemand or refuse. He dangles on my line and not the other way around.\\n“Faster .” I push my tits up for him. “Do it faster .”\\nHe breathes through his teeth, stroking himself harder and faster , and I\\nwatch his mouth open and close as he longs for my breasts.\\nI slip my hand down my jeans and inside my panties.\\nHe groans, watching me finger myself. “T ake ’em down.”\\nI shake my head, swirling my wet clit.\\nHe growls again. “Take your panties down and show me something\\nwet.”\\n“Noah, no.”\\nI can’t. I’ll lose control. This is what I love with Noah, and what I want\\nto keep. I can love him but stay level.\\nHe pants. “I want your panties balled up on my bedroom floor  so bad,\\nbut I’ll fuck you right here if I have to, T iernan.”\\nI eye the couch in the corner of the shop, a moment of surrender almost\\ntaking me over .\\n“Let me in your bed tonight,” he asks. “He won’ t find out.”\\nI open my mouth to say some thing—to refuse—but I can’t force the\\nwords. I don’ t want to deny him. I want him to be happy .\\n“He won’t find out,” he whisp ers again. “He’ll never know , Tiernan.\\nDrop the pack. Just let go.”\\nEverything washes over me at once, and I almost say “yes.”\\nDrop the pack .\\nLike that day in the ocean and everything I was carrying that would\\ndrag me down and drown me. Just let go.\\nI almost do.\\nInstead, I dive in, holding his face and kissing his temple as he strokes\\nhimself. “I’m sorry .” And I slide out from under the bike and climb to my feet, running\\ntoward the kitchen door as I pull down my tank top and fix the flannel.\\n“Tiernan,” he groans behind me, sounding disappointed, but I don’t\\nstop.\\nRunning into the house, I slam the shop door and bolt up the stairs,\\nheading to my bedroom.\\nWhat the hell is the matter with me? Noah is the only one I’m\\ncompletely fearless around. Why would I complicate that?\\nI wanted  him. I wanted to climb on top of him and love him and hold\\nhim and make sure he wasn’ t alone.\\nI swing my door open and pull off the flannel, kicking off my shoes and\\nsocks, because I’m sweating.\\nThese fucking men. I squeeze my eyes shut, still aching between my\\nthighs. My clothes itch, and my heart pounds.\\n“Tiernan.”\\nI blink, hearing my name. I turn my head, looking out my door, across\\nthe hall, and seeing Jake standing in his room wearing a towel. He uses\\nanother to dry the back of his hair as steam billows out of the bathroom and\\ninto his room.\\n“You okay?” he asks.\\nI stare at his bare chest and muscular calves, the towel tucked just above\\nhis groin, and the pulse in my clit throbs harder .\\nI shake my head.\\nSlowly , I unfasten my jeans and push them down my legs, his eyes on\\nme as I pull my tank top over my head.\\nI see his breathing turn heavy as his eyes fall down my body , and I don’t\\nhesitate another moment. I slip my panties down my legs, baring my pussy ,\\nand he’s off. Dropping the towel in his hand, he stalks across the hall and\\ninto my room, slamming my door closed before he grabs me. I have a\\nmoment to inhale before he lifts me into his arms, my legs wrapping around\\nhis body , and his hand smacks my ass.\\nI whimper but smile as he pins me up against my wall, fisting my breast\\nas he thrusts inside of me and pumps me hard and fast, his grunts and\\ngrowls hot on my neck.\\nI moan, everything hot and alive under my skin. I’ve loved in Jake the\\nsame things I’ve loved not seeing in Noah, but… I may have had it wrong.\\nJake’ s not in control, either .  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI tear off the sheet and crumple it up in my fist, tossing it onto the table. I\\nhate sketching. I’ve been at this for two hours and every design comes out\\nlooking ten times worse than whatever ’s in my head. I can’ t draw .\\nI pick up a freshly sharpened pencil and start again, remembe ring the\\nlines and curves  of the chest out in the shop as “Blue Blood” by LAUREL\\nplays on my phone on the table. Using light strokes, I fill in the feathers and\\nfiligree, not really worried about the bones of the design, just the colors.\\nEvery scheme I use seems childish, but I want to have an idea of what to do\\nbefore I use any paint on it.\\nI lay my head down on my arm, picking up the gold pencil and brushing\\nthe highest points of the feathers as the snow falls out the window . I like\\nthis time of day. The sun just before it rises, the house is quiet, except for\\nmy soft music, and everything is asleep. My mug of coffee sits close, steam\\nrising into the air, and I’m awak e before anyone else but rested . Not like at\\nnight where I’m crashing into my pillow at ten p.m. because I’m exhausted.\\nMy fingers work, peeking out of my long sweater , but a shadow falls\\nover the paper as someone stops behind me. I pause.\\nBut only for a moment.\\nI take a breath and continue, glossing up the trim of the chest as Kaleb\\nwalks to the coffee pot and pours himself a cup. I knew it was him, because\\nJake and Noah would’ve said ‘good morning’.\\nHe stands at the counter , and even though I’m tempted to look up to see\\nif he’s watching  me, I don’t. I switch out pencils, my hand hovering over the choices before I finally pick up the violet and light blue ones. Keeping\\nmy head nestled on my arm, I shade the left tip of the chest, working\\ndiagonally before switching to the blue to continue the design.\\nHe comes over , standing behind me again.\\nWhat, Kaleb?\\nI dig in my brows, my body tense and bracing myself for whatever\\nmean shit he’ll do now , but after a moment, I decide to ignore him.\\nI continue shading in some blue.\\nUnfortunately , the same thing happens, and I pause. I want the colors to\\nblend, but the change from lavender to blue is too abrupt. I scribble harder ,\\nchanging directi ons, trying to make the colors melt into each other , but he’s\\nstanding behind  me, and I can’t concentrate. I lift my head, struggling to\\nmake it work as I switch from shading in lines to shading in circles.\\nStill, though…the transition is too sharp. I reach up to tear the sheet off\\nand throw it away .\\nBut his hand comes down on top of mine, stopping me. I’m about to\\nthrow him off, but he gently pulls the pencil out of my hand, sets his coffee\\ndown, and plant s his other hand on the table, leaning over me. I watch as he\\nholds the pencil between his fingers, pinching it all the way down at the tip,\\nand shades in a circular motion along my line and then uses his thumb to\\nrub the colors together , blending it just how I wanted.\\nHe continues, the wind howling outside as a curtain of snow falls\\nbeyond the windows, and my shoulders relax a little as he picks up the\\nviolet again, bringing streams and drops into the blue, almost like a…\\nLike a water color . I want to smile. It’s exactly what I was seeing in my\\nhead.\\nI pick up the green pencil and start on the final section, shading in\\ncircles like he does. He follows,  blending in his blue with my sea green, and\\nour hands brush as we rub the colors with our fingers.\\nDoes he draw a lot? I move my head, wanting to look up at him, but I\\ncatch myself in time.\\nI finish the legs and add some fancy handles to the drawe rs, only\\nfaltering for a moment when I see him uncrumple some of my previous\\ndrawings. He lays one down on the table, smoothing it out and hands it to\\nme.\\nI swallow . It’s the teal and black design.\\n“I liked that one,” I murmur . But it looks too…I don’ t know… Beetlejuice ? I thought it was childish.\\nI stare at the amateur sketch and pick up my pencil and ruler, adding\\nmore stripes to the drawers.\\n“I used to do so many drawings when I was little,” I tell him. “My\\nhouse with trees and a rainbow . I’d put it on the refrigerator for my parents\\nto see. Display it really pretty and nice and high, so they’d notice it when\\nthey got home.”\\nHis hand remains planted on the table at my side, and I pick up the\\nblack pencil, shading stripes.\\n“I was so excite d by how dream y the picture was,” I go on. “There was\\nso much color , I just wanted to jump into it like it was one of the chalk\\ndrawings in Mary Poppins. ” I laugh a little. “Kind of precious and\\nmagical.”\\nI switch  out the pencil, picking up a teal one as a lump forms in my\\nthroat.\\nAll I can manag e is a whisper . “Hours later, I’d find them hidde n in the\\ntrash.” I flex my jaw as needles  prick my throat. “They didn’ t go with the\\ndécor .”\\nTears rise up from my chest. I’d forgotten about that. But now—years\\nlater—it hurts more than ever. Couldn’ t they have kept it up for a day? Was\\nit impossible to say one nice thing?\\nI want to break, to let it go, but he catches me just in time. Suddenly , I\\nfeel him. His lips in my hair as he leans over me.\\nI close my eyes and stop breathing as the silent house surrounds us. He\\nholds me. Barely touching me, he holds me.\\nChills spread down my arms as his mouth grazes my hair. He inhales,\\nlike he’s drawing in my scent, and I pause in my work as he reaches around\\nand cups my face.\\nHis nose trails down my temple, his hot breath heavy on my cheek.\\nLike he’ s struggling.\\nBringing his other hand up, he holds me to him as my whole body\\nwarms under the blanket of him.\\nNo kissing. No touching anywhere else.\\nJust warmth. He’s not in contro l and neither am I, and even though my\\nnerves fire under my skin and my blood races, my fingers don’t fist and my\\nmuscles don’ t tense anymore. I feel safe. And when he wraps his arms around me, holding me tight, I fight to\\nkeep the tears away again.\\nKaleb.\\nHe just holds me. Or holds onto me. Either way, I don’t want it to ever\\nbe over .\\nI know what he wants, though,  so it can’t ever start. He can’t do this,\\nand I can’ t let it happen.\\nI pull my face away , out of his hold, and it almost makes me sick,\\nbecause I don’ t want to lose his touch, but…\\n“I guess  a slut is good enough,” I mumble. “When you’re desperate\\nenough.”\\nPulling away from him, I pick up my pencil, feeling him stand there\\nfrozen as I quickly dry my eyes and keep working.\\nI wait for him to explode. To spit on me or handle me like he always\\ndoes, because he throws tantrums when he doesn’ t get what he wants, but…\\nHe just leaves—pushes of f the table, turns around, and leaves.\\nI don’ t see him for the rest of the day .\\n \\n \\nI curl my dry toes inside my socks and warm boots, the cold from the snow\\nstarting to seep through as I tip my face back and let it stick to my nose and\\nlashes.\\nI twirl, faking some ballet, and I can see Jake watching me from over by\\nthe barn, probably shaking his head as he tosses tennis balls for the dogs to\\nfetch.\\nWhat? Growing up in Southern California, I don’t get to experience\\nmuch precipitation. It just makes my day , is all.\\nI stop, the world  spinning, and I finally lock eyes with him and see him\\ntrying not to smile but failing miserably .\\nI don’t care if I look like an imbecile. I was miserable three months ago,\\nand now I’m not. I jog over to him, the snow crunching under my feet as\\nNoah and Kaleb load up his snowmobile and disappear back inside the\\nshop.\\nI look after Kaleb. “Is he going with you?” I ask Jake.\\n“Nope.”\\n“Doesn’ t he usually?” I was kind of counting on Kaleb to join Jake on his four-day foray up to\\ntheir other cabin. It’s where Kaleb was when I first got to town, and I’ve\\nsince learned he and Jake like to spend time there whenever they don’t have\\na deadline looming. They use it for extended hunting trips or when they\\nwant to be closer to better fishing.\\nIt’s definitely not a place that can fit all of us, and there’ s no electricity ,\\nWiFi, or plumbing, so I’m out, but I’m told it’s beautiful, especially in the\\nsummer .\\nI might not be here to see it, though.\\nJake simply shrugs at my quest ion, and I gather he doesn’ t know why\\nKaleb is hanging back, either . I can deal with Noah on my own. Especially\\nsince he’s backed off since the night in the shop under the bike a couple\\nweeks ago.\\nAnd Kaleb has barely looked at me once in that time, either .\\nI look longingly at the scruf f Jake is growing like a winter coat or\\nsomething. I guess I can get ahead on some schoolwork while he’ s away .\\n“This was a good idea,” he says.\\nI follow  his gaze as he heads just inside the barn. We stop at the coop\\nand the monster truck tires Noah helped me cut in half. Three halves are\\nstacked on top of each other , the insides filled with hay and chickens.\\nI grin. “Re-appropriation of materials and it’s supposed to do a good job\\nof blocking the wind,” I inform him.\\nAnother of my DIY projects. The animals seem quite content in their\\nwinter homes.\\n“You going to be okay tonight?” he asks.\\nI almost laugh.\\nBut then I remember the last time I was alone with both boys at the\\nsame time without him.\\n“Probably not,” I tease. “Y ou should take me with you.”\\nHis gaze turns heated, and I watch as his eyes drop down my body for a\\nmoment.\\nI don’t want to rough it like that exactly , but it wouldn’ t be a chore\\nkeeping him company .\\n“I’d spend all my time trying to keep you warm,” he mumbles.\\nYeah, pr obably .\\nVisions flood my brain of us, a bed, and a fire. Who needs food?\\nI smirk to myself. “What?” he asks.\\nI force my smile away . “Nothing.”\\nHe looks at me suspiciously , and I smile again despite myself.\\nHe rolls his eyes and yanks the strings of my cap down, the top covering\\nmy eyes as he walks away .\\n“I like the hat,” he tells me.\\nI push it back, feigning a scowl as both of us head out of the barn.\\n \\n \\nSwiping the page on my Kindle , I hear the buzzer on the dryer  go off and\\nreach for the basket. I hesitate, quickly skimming the rest of the paragraph\\nbefore setting the device down.\\nOpening up the dryer , I pull out my clothes. Comparative economic\\nsystems  in various government types…  This class might’ve been better\\ntaken in person. Not that it’s particularly difficult to follow , but I have\\nquestions and talking to the Van der Berg men about world issues would be\\nlike watching Y oda get a manicure.\\nJake doesn’t vote, because “as long as they stay off my peak, we’ve got\\nno problems.” As if tax laws, pollution, or nuclear war will respect his\\nproperty line. Noah doesn’ t vote, because “that seems like work,” and I’m\\npretty sure Kaleb just doesn’ t care.\\nMirai would be good for some  conversation. I’m overdue calling her\\nanyway .\\nI reach in, pulling out the rest of my clothes, and pick up the basket,\\nkicking the dryer door closed before I head upstairs. Once in my room, I\\ndump the clothes on my bed.\\nI pick out my jeans and all the clothes that need to be hung up, laying\\nthose in a separa te pile, and I reach back in, searching for all my underwear\\nand bras.\\nI sift through the clothes, pulling out my blue lacy pair and the black\\nbra, but as I search through the items of clothing, I don’ t see anything else.\\nI frown.\\nThis load is six days’ worth of clothes. Where did five pairs of panties\\ngo?\\nI search  again, finding my two boring sports bras, but still, no\\nunderwear . They may be stuck in jeans or on some shirts, but as I continue to tear through the pile, I don’ t see them.\\nWhat the hell?\\nI stop and think. Jake tore a pair weeks ago in the truck, but that should\\nbe all I’m missing. I search my drawers, under my bed, in my bed, and in\\nthe bathroom before heading back down to the laundry room and scanning\\nthe floor . I check inside the washer and drawer , thinking I may have\\naccidentally left some.\\nBut nothing.\\nThe only other place would be…\\nHeading back upstairs, I enter Jake’ s room, hearing him in the shower\\nas he gets ready to head out on his fishing trip, and kneel down, looking\\nunderneath the bed, tables, and inside the sheets.\\nI didn’ t take them of f anywhere else but here or my room.\\nWhere…\\nAnd then it hits me.\\nI wince. “Ugh, Jesus.”\\nChar ging over to Noah’ s room, I find it empty as he and Kaleb still\\nwork out in the shop, and start looking in his bed, in his pillowcase, under\\nhis pillow…\\nSo nasty . Please tell me he wouldn’ t do that. And with five pairs? Is he\\nfourteen years old, for crying out loud?\\nBut after minutes of searching, I still don’ t find anything.\\nI slam his pillow down on the bed, losing patience. They didn’t just\\nsprout legs.\\nThen I raise my eyes, remembering the only place I have left to look.\\nKaleb.\\nMy pulse starts to race. He wouldn’ t do that.\\nWould he?\\nThe idea of Kaleb wrapping my little red panties around his…\\nAnd then stroking it… I…\\nI’m warm betwe en my thighs all of a sudden, but I shake my head. It’s\\nstill a violation. And since his room is the only place left to look, I’ll violate\\nhim right back.\\nLeaving Noah’ s room, I shut the door and head toward the narro w, dark\\nstairwell as the shower still runs in the bathroom. I hesitate only a moment\\nbefore pushing myself up the stairs, my heart hammering at the idea of\\ngoing somewhere I haven’ t once seen yet. And at the idea of him catching  me. I’d have to be quick. His temper\\nsucks.\\nI twist the doorknob, half expect ing it to be locked from the outside, but\\nit gives,  and I enter , immediately seeing sunlight streaming in through the\\nfar window . Thank God. I don’t want to have to turn on a light and have\\nhim see it from the outside.\\nStepping in, I close the door softly behind me and look around the large\\nroom, suddenly for getting why I’m here.\\nI exhale , a smile playing on my lips. A large bed sits betw een two\\nwindows which must be the gables on the west side of the house—the same\\nside my balcony faces right below him. Built-in bookshelves line the walls,\\nspilling with books that are stuffed and stacked into every available space.\\nVertically , horizontally , on top of each other… Nothing has a dust jacket,\\nand I know some of them have to be very old. He doesn’ t read all these,\\ndoes he? I’ve never seen him read.\\nA Persian-style rug covers the floor, the visible dark wood scuffed and\\nunpolished, and a small fireplace sits a few feet down the wall from the\\ndoor I just came  through. I walk over, seeing the charred remnants of logs\\nhe’s burned. I inhale, smelling the burned bark as well as something else.\\nAlmost like patchouli. Or ber gamot.\\nA table sits next to the wall with the belts and his supplies for working\\nthem, and I find more books on the floor next to his bed. The walls are\\npretty bare, but they’re not the lighter timber used in the rest of the house.\\nThis room looks like it’s somet hing in the upstairs of an Old English pub.\\nI’m surprised I don’ t see old paintings on the walls.\\nI walk over to the table, picking up a few of the animal bones and\\nsearching for more information. This room says so much.\\nAnd still, so little.\\nHe likes leatherwork. He likes to read. I don’t see a TV, a computer , or\\nany electronics, though I know he has a speaker up here or something,\\nbecause I hear his music sometimes.\\nIt’s cozy, though. Dark, warm, and comfortable—a big, cushioned chair\\nsitting in the corner of the room with another stack of books sitting next to\\nit.\\nWalking over to his bedside table, I open the drawer , finding only an old\\ncopy of The Three Musketeers , a pen, and some condoms. I pick up the\\nbook, smelling it. Tingles spread up my spine. It smells like the room.\\nI bet it’s nice in here when the fire is lit. Quiet, peaceful… warm. I look\\ndown at the bed, my mouth going dry .\\nI whip the sheet and blanket back, running my hands over his bed and\\nsearching for my panties. I’m guessing this is where he’d be when he jerked\\noff with them.\\nFinding nothing , I dive down to my hands and knees, crawling around\\nthe bed to check the floor .\\nBut as I reach the foot of the bed, I see something and stop. Three\\ngrooves are dug into the wood, and I reach out my hand, immediately fitting\\nmy forefinger , middle finger , and ring finger into the scratches.\\nSomething scratched the floor . Or someone.\\nI lick my parched lips, the reality of the distance between the police and\\nme finally dawning. It should’ve dawned months ago.\\nRising to my feet, I search his drawers, his other bedside table, and any\\nother little nooks and crannies  I can find, but nothing. This is fucking\\nridiculous. Jake isn’t the panty-raiding type, and Noah wouldn’ t steal nearly\\nevery pair of sexy underwear I owned, because he’d want to see me\\nwearing them! I know it’ s Kaleb.\\nI grab his pillow and dig inside, searching the last place I know of, and\\nthen take the other one, sticking my hand inside there, too.\\nI feel something  and stop, rubbi ng it between my fingers. Cloth, silky…\\nI pull it out and look down at the red ribbon in my hand.\\nThe red hair ribbon.\\nMy red hair ribbon.\\nHeat courses under my skin as heat pools in my belly .\\nThe corner of my mouth turns up in a sly smile. Well, it’s not my\\npanties, but it’ s mine. T ossing his pillow back down, I tie the ribbon into my\\nhair into a sweet, little bow .\\nIt’s not much, but piece by piece, Kaleb is coming into view .\\nHe might hate me.\\nBut he thinks about me.\\n \\n \\n“It’s so quiet.” Noah sits to my right, in his father ’s seat, and I glance up, barely\\nmeeting his eyes before I look back down at my textbook. I take another\\nbite of my biscuit, not replying.\\nJake left hours ago. I wished he’d left earlier , because it’s started\\nsnowing again, and now it’s dark. I hate the thought of him out there alone.\\nWhy didn’t Kaleb go with him?  Or all of us? I could’ve sucked it up. We\\ndon’t need fish that badly .\\nI turn the page, chewing my food as a shingle on the roof bangs in the\\nwind and the ice maker drops new cubes in the freezer . The ribbon tickles\\nmy temp le, and I fight not to smile as I feel Kaleb’ s eyes boring into me\\nfrom across the table.\\n“I never really realized my father was the life of the party at dinner ,”\\nNoah adds, trying to get us to talk.\\nBut I’m enjoying Kaleb’ s attention a little too much to make\\nconversation right now .\\nNoah reaches over and touches my ribbon. “This is cute.”\\nI give him a smile but then flash my gaze to Kaleb, seeing his jaw flex.\\n“So you want to watch a movie tonight?” Noah asks.\\n“A movie?”\\n“There’ s a sequel where the same cops pick her up for smokin g weed\\nand take her back to the station house,” he tells me, wagging his eyebrows.\\n“All night long. Lots of prisoners.”\\nI chuckle. “Sounds hot.” I close my text and drop the rest of my biscuit\\nto my plate, brushing off my hands. “But I have about fifteen critical\\nresponses to finish.”\\nI rise, picking up my plate and glass.\\n“I’ll make sure to avoid the living room, though,” I say, setting my\\ndishes on the counter and turning around to grab my book and highlighter .\\nBut as I move around the table to go to my room, Noah slides his chair\\nin front of me, blocking my way .\\nI stop, straightening.\\nHis eyes glide down my body , like the oversized sweater and sleep\\nshorts are just what he likes, but really , he’s just been without a woman for\\nlonger than he wants, and anything looks good at this point.\\nHis gaze trails back up, meeting mine again. “Come here,” he says.\\n“Get out of my way .”\\nHis lips turn tight, his usual Noah-humor gone. “I said come here.” I glance at Kaleb who looks between his brother and me, tense  but not\\nready to defend me yet.\\n“He’ s not gonna help you,” Noah tells me as if reading my thoughts.\\nAnd then he reaches out, grabs my sweater , and pulls me into him, my\\nbook falling onto the floor as he pulls my knees around him. I straddle his\\nlap, growling as he wraps an arm around my waist and locks one fist at the\\nback of my scalp.\\nI plant my hands on his chest, trying to push myself away , but he holds\\nmy hair tight.\\n“Noah, stop it. Y ou’re drunk.”\\nThe four empty beer bottles on the table clank as I struggle, kicking the\\nleg of the table.\\n“No, I’m bored.” He inches up toward my mouth. “I want to make love\\nto you, T iernan. I wanna fuck my father ’s little whore.”\\nI rear my hand back and slap him as hard as I can across the cheek. His\\nface whips to the side, and he sucks in a breath. But he laughs, almost\\nmoaning with pleasure.\\n“You want it, too,” he continue s, looking up at me as he presses his\\ngroin into mine. “Ride me like this. Right here on this chair . Tell him I\\nmade you do it.” His hot breath on my mouth makes my skin tingle. “Tell\\nhim I made you do what you’re supposed to do for all the men in the house.\\nRight here on the kitchen table every morning after you serve us our\\nfucking breakfast.”\\nI fist his T-shirt , the ridge of his cock in his jeans rubbing me through\\nmy thin shorts, and I breathe hard, still trying to push against his hold.\\nHe releases my hair and plants his forehead to mine, whispering to me.\\n“I want you.” His breathing turns shallow , like he’ s in pain. “I want you.”\\nThe longing in his voice seeps through, and even though my thighs are\\nwarm and there’ s a longing for something more that I can’t explain—or\\ndon’t want to—I push him away .\\n“Until the roads clear ,” I grit out.\\nAs soon as they both have access to the women in town, I won’ t be so\\nneeded.\\nI slap his chest and push him away, stumbling back to my feet. I back\\naway from him, swiping my textbook of f the floor .\\nNoah rises, advancing on me, and Kaleb stands, too. “You needed affection from him,” Noah says, referring to his father .\\n“He abused his authority with you. With me, you can play. With me, you\\ncan call the shots.”\\nI narrow  my eyes on him, confu sed. Is that what he thinks is happening\\nbetween his father and me? A little lost orphan who needs love?\\nHe really thinks Jake took advantage.\\n“When I was sixteen, this ninet een-year -old guy took me home from a\\nparty and wanted to do the same things to me that your father does to me,” I\\nsay to Noah. “I didn’ t let him, because I didn’ t feel anything around him.”\\nThey both remain silent as I continue.\\n“When Senator De Haven’ s son cornered me at the Governo r’s Ball\\nwith a couple of his frat buddies …” I go on, “promising to treat me right, I\\ndidn’ t want that, either , and he got a bloody lip to show for it. When\\nTerrance Holcom b walked into that lake with his beautiful body and just as\\nmany cocky words coming out of his mouth as you, I didn’ t escape into him\\nfor a few moments of instant gratification.”\\nI may have been a vir gin when I came here, but I wasn’ t stupid.\\n“And when you all took me out for my birthday , and I was dancing, and\\nsome of the local guys were watching me, I couldn’ t care less, because all I\\ncould care about was you and Jake and…” I throw a look at Kaleb, “and\\nhow you were watching me. Of how I didn’ t want or need anything from\\nanyone else, because I have everything I want in this house.”\\nI’m not some twit who latches onto anyone who shows her attention or\\nsoaks up affection from anyone who comes along. Jake didn’ t mark me. I\\nchose.\\n“I know how to stop things I don’t want,” I tell Noah. “I know how to\\nsay no.”\\n“So?”\\n“So, no,” I reply .\\nI grab my book of f the ground and brush past him, leaving the kitchen.  \\n \\n \\nN o a h\\n \\nIf she would just let me in…\\nI know she wants me. I could  see it on the couch that night on her\\nbirthday , and I saw it in the shop when we worked under the bike. I was\\nright when I told her I’d make love to her. I wouldn’ t run out of the room or\\ndie for it to be over . I’d love to make her feel good.\\nI stare up at my ceiling, my arm tucked under my head as I chew the\\nshit out of how this night went to hell. I fucked up. I got drunk and blew it.\\nKaleb is asleep,  and Tiernan has been in bed for hours. I swallow the\\nlump in my throat and close my eyes as my dick swells with heat. I reach\\ndown and grab it through my jeans, damn near groaning at the ache.\\nShe should be in here. Quietly and sweetly riding me, taking advantage\\nof the fact that he’s not here tonight and Kaleb won’ t give us away . I close\\nmy eyes, massaging it and feeling it harden by the second.\\nOr I should be in there. Kissing her and stirring her body. Making it\\nimpossible to say no, because I’ll eat her so good, she’ll beg for me.\\nAnd before she can think twice , I’ll be inside of her, keeping up with\\nher like a young man can.\\nI squeeze my dick, grunting at the need. Jesus. I need to go rub one out.\\nI’m not going to get to sleep.\\nRising from the bed, I stand up and fasten my jeans, leaving my shirt on\\nthe floor as I head for the door .\\nBut as I do, I hear a muf fled cry and stop, training my ears.\\nWhat is that? A cry sounds out from Tiernan’ s room, and I jerk my eyes to the wall\\nbetween us, confused. My father’s not here. She’s not in there with him.\\nWhy…\\nThere’ s another grunt followed  by what sounds like a sob. What the\\nhell?\\nI open my door and look left toward her bedroom door, seeing it’s\\nclosed. I walk for it, but just then Kaleb comes pounding down the stairs\\nfrom his room, also wearing dark jeans and no shirt. His eyes are half-\\nclosed, and his hair is mussed like he just woke up.\\nHe doesn’t stop or make eye contact with me, simply opens her door as\\nif this is routine. He enters, and I follow , hearing Tiernan scream as he\\nwalks quietly around her bed. I wince, seeing her clench her T-shirt, her\\neyes closed and her face half-buried in her pillow as she cries out again. I\\nstop breathing for a moment. She looks like she’ s in pain. What—\\nHer hair falls in her face, her skin damp with sweat, and her entire body\\nis as tight as a rubber band.\\nI stare at her , realization dawning.\\nShe’s not awake.\\n“What’ s wrong with her?” I ask, hanging back by the door .\\nBut Kaleb just waves a hand, shooing me away as he lies down next to\\nher and pulls her into his body . I watch as she immediately falls in, burying\\nher head in his neck as the cries subside and her breathing starts to calm. He\\nyawns, pulling her sheet and blanket up over them like this is normal.\\n“Does she do this a lot?”\\nNightmares aren’ t supposed to sound like that, are they? As Kaleb\\nsettles in, though, she falls completely quiet, nestling into him as her\\nslumber continues, peaceful and quiet.\\nKaleb lies on his side, holding her and fitting her head under his chin as\\nboth of them go back to sleep.\\nI stand there, watching them. Does she know she screams like that at\\nnight?\\nDoes she know he comes in? I’ve never heard her do that.\\nOf course, she’s not always sleeping alone. Maybe Kaleb only has to\\ncome in when she does.\\nHe used to have nightmares when we were little, but he’d wake up.\\nA smell hits my nose, and I blink, hearing the dogs barking as I inhale. I\\nturn my head toward the hallway , scrunching up my face, the strong scent almost making my eyes water .\\nI whisper to Kaleb. “Do you smell that?”\\nIt smells like a fire, but we didn’t leave anything burning. Walking out\\nof the room, I head downstairs and glance at the fireplace, making sure it’s\\nout, before heading for the front door. But as I walk, I spot a glow coming\\nthrough the kitchen window . I narrow my eyes, stopping in my tracks. What\\nthe…?\\nRunning through  the kitchen, I nearly trip over the dogs rushing at me\\nbefore I lean over the sink and peer out the window . My stomach rolls.\\n“Oh, fuck,” I gasp.\\n“Kaleb!” I shout, whipping around and running for the front door. “Fire\\nin the barn!”\\nThe animals. The barn is right next to the stable. Shit!\\nI pull on the sweatshirt hanging  on the back of the closet and slip into\\nmy boots, grabbing my gloves out of my coat pocket.\\n“Kaleb!” I yell again. “Hurry!”\\nHis footfalls hit heavy from above, and I hear him charge down the\\nstairs, but I don’t wait. Whipping open the front door, I race outside, almost\\nslipping on my ass as I grab the railing and rush down the steps of the deck.\\nThe snow crunches under my boots, some falling inside, because we got\\nanother six inches today , and I didn’ t have a chance to fasten them.\\nBut I don’ t care. I stop and look up at the barn, barely able to move for a\\nmoment. What the hell? Flames  engulf the ridge of the roof, and it’ll be a\\nmiracle if the hose isn’t frozen, otherwise we lose everything. How the hell\\ndid this start?\\nKaleb grabs my collar , and I suck in a breath, meeting his eyes. He\\nscowls and jerks his chin toward the barn, snapping me out of it. I nod.\\nHe runs for the shop, opening the bay doors, and I race for the barn. I\\nrun inside, the smoke thick and stifling as I try to catch a breath. Covering\\nmy nose and mouth with my arm, I yank out Tiernan’ s tires, the chickens\\ninside squawking and flapping their wings. Coughing, I dive back inside\\nand grab a rope, slipping a loop around the cow’ s fucking head and\\ndragging her out. I try to get air, but I can’t stop coughing.  Everything\\nstings and burns as I struggle to find my way out through the smoke.\\nA whine echoes from above, and I look up just in time to see a piece of\\nthe loft floor break away , dangle , and fall. I run, the board hitting  the animal\\nas I pull her out into the cold night air . Kaleb pulls the fire hose out of the shop, and I work to move everything\\nas far away from the barn as possible.\\n“What happened?” T iernan cries.\\nI look up, seein g her standing in the snow in her boots but nothing\\ncovering her T -shirt and sleep shorts.\\nI turn to Kaleb, watching him fuck around with the lever , but nothing’ s\\ncoming out. No water .\\n“Fuck!” I growl, fisting my hair .\\n“Go check if it’ s frozen!” T iernan shouts.\\nI look over to see she’ s yelling at Kaleb and pointing to the water tower .\\nI shake my head. We had a warm  day yesterday . It might not be frozen,\\nbut there’ s no way that’ll help. What are we going to do? Fill buckets and\\nlaunch them at the flames from down here?\\nKaleb goes anyway , dropping the hose, and I’m about to follow , but\\nTiernan rushes past me, and my heart lodges in my damn throat.\\n“The horses!” she yells.\\nDebris from the loft falls into the barn, and with all the wood and hay,\\nit’s only a matter of time before it reaches the stable. She leaps inside,\\ndisappearing.\\n“Tiernan, no!” I shout.\\nI run after her, but before I can get inside, she’s pulling Rebel out,\\nstruggling to get him to move as her hair flies in her face and the wind\\nwhips against us.\\nDumb fuckin’ horses. They can be so smart, but they’ll damn well sit\\nthere while the building falls down around them.\\nI help her, both of us yanking the harness and then…I hear a slap, and\\nthe horse bolts out of the stable and into the night.\\nAn engine fires up, and I look around the corner , seeing Kaleb sitting in\\nthe digger and trying to move through the snow , toward the water tower .\\nI freeze. He’ s going to…\\nOh, shit.\\n“Kaleb!” I yell, but then I fall silent, knowing he’s right. It’s the only\\nway. We have to get the horses out of here, though.\\nTiernan dives back inside, and I follow her, going for Ruffian as she\\nhurries for Shawnee. Heat engulfs us as the crackles of the fire surround us,\\nand I hear a moan in the barn as the rafters probably start to give way.\\nJesus. “Tiernan, go!” I bellow . “Get out of here!”\\nI slap Ruffian, sending him running out the door, but a loud scream\\npierces the air, and I whip around, seeing Tiernan pinned in the stall\\ndoorway as Shawnee squeezes past her. Smoke billows as blood trickles\\ndown the wood, and she cries out, slapping the horse again. Shawnee goes\\nrunning, and I leap out of his way as he races past me and then scurry over\\nto Tiernan. Blood pours down her left arm, and I grab her, wrapping my\\narm around her .\\nWe cough, spilling out of the stable, and Tiernan falls to the ground as\\nsomething creaks and tips behind me. I spin around just in time to see Kaleb\\nslam the digger into the wooden water tower , giving it more and more\\npower until the tank tips over and water sloshes, and then it spills,\\ncascading over the barn and stable and dousing the flames.\\nMy shou lders fall, the wind nipping at my lips and ears as I watch the\\nglow die, the smoke pour into the air , and the fire slowly extinguish.\\nExhaling, I turn and drop to my knees.\\nTiernan.\\nTaking her arm in one hand and her face in the other , I tip her chin up.\\n“Look at me,” I tell her .\\nShe blinks her eyes open, flurries kicking up from all the ruckus and\\nflitting across her eyelashes. Her blood drips over my fingers, and I slowly\\nturn her arm, seeing the slice in the skin on her upper arm.\\nBlood spills from the wound, and I squeeze her arm, trying to stop the\\nflow, but she hisses, her eyes watering.\\n“How’d you know to slap the horses?” I ask, trying to take her mind off\\nthe pain.\\n“I didn’ t,” she chokes out. “It’ s just what they do in the movies.”\\nI laugh to myself.\\nShe’s shivering. W e need to get her inside.\\n“How’d the fire start?” she asks, looking over my shoulder .\\nI shake my head . “Could’ve been electrical. Could’ve been the furnace.\\nWho knows?”\\n“He’ll blame us.”\\n“He’ll definitely blame us,” I grumble, putting her good arm around my\\nneck and lifting her to her feet again.\\n“You did good, though.”\\nI look in her eyes. No hesitation. She went straight for the horses. Scaring the shit out of me, yes, but she was brave.\\n“Just don’ t do that again, okay?” I ask her .\\nI start to help her toward the house, but Kaleb suddenly appears, sweeps\\nher into his arms and away from me, jerking his chin from me to the barn.\\nI don’t have time to argue before he turns and carries her back to the\\nhouse, her pained eyes locked only on him as they go.\\nI clench my jaw , watching them disappear into the house.\\nAnd then I turn around to clean up the fucking mess in the barn like I’m\\ntold.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI suck in air between my teeth . The gash is too deep.\\nLetting out a sob, I turn my face away from the blood as Kaleb inspects\\nmy arm.\\nWhat do I do? We’re miles over snow and dangerous roads from any\\nhospital, and it hurts. What if it gets infected?\\nMy knees shake. I want Jake here.\\nAfter Kaleb brought me inside, he sat me down on the kitche n table,\\nwrapped up my arm, and started  a fire before running back outside to help\\nNoah. The fire looked all but extinguished, but they had to get the animals\\nback inside shelter , and since the shop was the only thing still fully intact\\nand not drenched in smoke, I watched through the kitchen window as they\\nloaded hay into the garage and brought in the animals. They left the bay\\ndoor cracked for fresh air, but that wouldn’ t stop the noxious mess Jake was\\ngoing to come home to in a couple days.\\nGod, he’s going  to be pissed. Half his barn is now useless, and the shop\\nwill smell like horseshit soon.\\nBut hey, at least the animals  will enjoy a temperature-controlled\\nenvironment for a while.\\nThe poor dogs pace around the kitchen table, looking at me with worry .\\nKaleb squeezes my arm, and an ache courses deep as it stings.\\n“Kaleb…” I beg.\\nI don’t know if it really hurts that much, or if I’m just scared. I can’t get\\nto a doctor if I need one. Turning, I meet his eyes, his brow etched as he grabs a clean towel and\\npresses my hand to it for pressure as he goes to the cabinets above the\\nfridge.\\n“Jesus fucking Christ,” I hear Noah growl and the front door slam shut.\\n“We’ve never had a fire up here. Not once!” He throws open the cabinet\\nnext to the sink and pulls out the bottle of Cuervo they keep there.\\n“Except that time I shot a flaming arrow into the gasoline jug when I\\nwas twelve, but I kind of knew  that was going to happen,” he mumbles.\\n“The only thing that got damaged then was my hide.”\\nI want to laugh, but I don’t have the energy. My hand wets with the\\nblood soaking through the towel as my legs dangle over the edge of the\\ntable. I hear the tequila slosh behind me as Noah downs a couple swallows,\\nand I look over , seeing Kaleb throw a red tin box on the table.\\nMy pulse kicks up a notch.\\nBut instead of coming back to the table, he walks behind me, and I hear\\nthe sink turn on. I look over my shoulder , seeing him wash his hands.\\nMy stomach churns and knots, and I bite my lip.\\n“Here.” Noah nudges me, the cool glass bottle hitting my shoulder .\\n“Drink this.”\\nI shake my head. I can’ t stomach anything right now .\\nKaleb comes over and opens the box, pulling out various tools.\\n“Were you guys awake?” I ask, looking between them. “I mean, thank\\nGod you caught the fire in time.”\\nNoah’ s gaze flashes to Kaleb, but neither of them answers. Kaleb takes\\nmy arm, gently pulling of f the sticky towel, and I groan, a tear spilling over .\\nChanging my mind, I grab the bottle out of Noah’ s hand and throw it\\nback, gulping down two huge swallows.\\nThe burn scorches my throat, and I cough, someone taking the bottle out\\nof my hand again, and I dry heave, ready to fucking throw up. That’ s nasty .\\nBut I grab the bottle again and force down another shot.\\nKaleb leans over the box, pulling out a needle and thread, and I watch,\\nthe tequila blazing a path to my stomach as he uses some sort of clamp to\\nthread the needle and then flick a lighter under it, sanitizing it.\\nWhat the fuck?\\nAnd then it hits me.\\nOh, no.\\nI shake my head. “Kaleb, no.” He shoots his eyes up to me, his dark green gaze unflinching.\\nBut his stomach —the top half of his body bare, because he never got\\ncompletely dressed when he ran outside—tightens with his heavy breaths.\\nAlmost like he’ s…nervous.\\nHe takes my arm, clenching his jaw, and presses his fingers into my\\narm, pinching the torn skin back together .\\nI cry out. “No, Kaleb, stop.”\\nI can’ t do this. I turn my face away , sucking in breaths.\\n“You have to do it,” Noah says, handing me the bottle again. “If you\\ndon’t, you might get an infection, and then you’ll wish you were dead.”\\nI down another swallow of the tequila.\\nKaleb’ s eyes meet mine once more, and then his fingers—red and\\nstained with my blood—pinch the skin closed again as he sticks the needle\\nthrough.\\nMy stomach churns, and I shake, a cold sweat hitting me as he pulls the\\nthread through. I bite my bottom lip until I taste blood. “Noah,” I sob.\\nIt fucking hurts. I want Jake. They don’t know what they’re doing. Isn’t\\nthere a super glue thing now? You know , where you glue your skin\\ntogether?\\nKaleb pulls the thread tight, a searing snake bite hitting my arm, and I\\nclench my teeth, tears hanging and threatening to fall.\\nFuck.\\nNoah hands me the bottle again, but I push it away . My stomach is\\nwarm, and I feel the lightness in my head, but I’m about to fucking throw\\nup.\\nI take deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling and trying to calm my damn\\nstomach, but Kaleb sticks the needle through my flesh again, and I can feel\\nthe blood spilling down my arm as white hot pain shoots off through my\\nbody .\\n“Please,” I cry . “Please stop.”\\nI shove him away , trying to get his hand off my arm. I can’t do this. We\\nhave to wait. Jake will know what to do. I can’t do this. I won’ t lay eyes on\\na doctor  for five more months. What if the pain never goes away ? What if it\\ndoesn’ t heal?\\nI pry his hand of f. “Get of f me,” I growl. “It hurts!”\\nHe stand s up, and before I know  I can tell what’ s happening, his hand\\nwhips across my face, and my neck twists so hard, a tendon nearly snaps. My eyes pop wide, my mouth falls open, and I stop crying, pulling in a\\nbreath as I sit there, my ears ringing and my body frozen.\\nWhat the fuck?\\nHe hit me.\\nHe hit me!\\nHe plants his fists on the sides of my thighs and leans down into my\\nface, and it takes a moment to get my bearings again because the room is\\nspinning.\\n“What the fuck!” I snarl and turn back around.\\nI raise my hand and slap him back, his head barely jerking with the\\nattack.\\n“You hit me!” I scream, anger hardening in my gut.\\nI shove him in the chest with both hands, hitting him again.\\n“But you’re not in pain anymore, are you?” Noah says in my ear behind\\nme.\\nI glare at Kaleb, but I process Noah’ s words, focusing on the feeling in\\nmy arm.\\nThe pain is there, but it’s dulled —the rage in my head too strong right\\nnow.\\nI don’ t feel sick anymore.\\nMy breathing turns shallow , and I stare at Kaleb who’ s still leaning\\ndown into me.\\nBut he doesn’ t wait for my shock to wear off. He sits back down in the\\nchair and jerks his chin at Noah, as if signaling something, and pinches me\\nagain, puncturing the skin with the needle.\\nNoah climbs on the table behind me, wrapping an arm around my waist\\nand threading a hand into the back of my scalp.\\nHe fists my hair, and I wince at the sting but exhale as the focus is taken\\noff the pain in my arm.\\nKaleb pulls the thread tight, and I close my eyes, sweat breaking out all\\nover my body at the onslaught. Jesus, fuck.\\nKaleb threads, Noah’s fist tightens, and I let my head fall back  against\\nhim, turning my lips into his neck to cry .\\nAgain and again, two more times, and my stomach rolls. I heave.\\n“Kaleb,” I beg.\\nHe darts his eyes up to me, and I look at him, nodding.\\nJust do it. Just… His brow s pinch , and he breath es hard, but he rises, hesitating  only a\\nmoment before he slaps me again. I cry out, squeezing my eyes shut and\\nmaking tears stream down my face.\\nI blow out a long, slow breath as the world spins.\\nHands suddenly cup my face, caressing so softly now—like feathers—\\nand then a mouth is on mine, gently kissing my lips. He nibbles and\\nsoothes, his teeth grabbing hold of my bottom lip and making my blood\\nwarm all the way down to my toes.\\nHeat fills my body , and it’s like I’m floating. His tongue touch es mine,\\nscorching and… Oh, God. I’m weightless. It tastes so good.\\nI run my hands up his stomach  and chest, and I start to circle my legs\\naround him, but I stop myself.\\n“Fin—” I stammer in a whisper . “Fin…finish it. Just finish it, please.”\\nThe lips leave me, and I turn my head as the needle pokes through, and I\\nlet out a cry, but it’s lost in Noah. His mouth is on mine now, and I scream\\nas he just holds me and I shake.\\nShit.\\n“Tiernan,” he whispers. “Shhhh…”\\nThe fire on his clothes wafts around me, and the next thing I know he’s\\nburying his face in my neck, not kissing, as he squeezes the front of my\\nthroat.\\n“Harder ,” I gasp.\\nHe sinks his teeth into my neck, squeezing me, and just as I feel the\\npinch of Kaleb’ s needle, I grab the back of Noah’ s head and turn into him,\\nbreathing in and out hard against his lips.\\n“Tiernan,” Noah  whispers, and I taste salt, but I’m not sure if it’s his\\ntear or mine. “I love you. Y ou’re so fucking ours. W e love you.”\\nHe kisse s my cheek and my forehead as Kaleb works, and I try to calm\\nmy breathing as the tingles from his mouth on my skin sink in.\\nA bottle  grazes my lips, and I take another drink as Kaleb bites off the\\nthread, cleans the blood of f my arm, and wraps me up with a bandage.\\nThe alcohol starts to warm my insides, the pain in my arm less sharp\\nthan it was.\\nMy cheek burns, though.\\nI open my eyes wide, drawing in a deep breath.\\n“You could’ve warned me,” I tell Kaleb, my voice thick with tears as I\\nstare down at him. “Y ou could’ve hit me anywhere else.” Why the face?\\nHe closes the kit and rises, taking the bloody gauze to the trash.\\nI set the bottle down and slide off the table. “Cici Diggins came out of\\nthe cave with you at the waterfall with a bloody nose that day .”\\n“What?” Noah hops of f the table, too.\\nBut Kaleb doesn’ t acknowledge  me. I stare at his back as he washes his\\nhands at the sink. His muscles flex, and his breathing is slow and\\nmethodical. T oo calm.\\nDoesn’ t he want to defend himself? She could be telling the truth. I’ve\\nseen him abusive. Throwing things, spitting, not taking ‘no’ for an\\nanswer…\\nHe slapped me without any hesitation tonight.\\nBut the dogs love him most, don’t they? They follow him, sleep with\\nhim, and make him smile when he doesn’ t think we see.\\nHe’s always ready to stand in front of me and keep me from harm. He\\ntries to connect, like when I was sketching.\\nNo matter what snide comment Noah makes or what his father demands\\nfrom him in his harsh tone, he doesn’ t say anything or start a fight. He just\\ndoes whatever he has to so people will leave him alone.\\nI look away , shaking my head. This is what women do, though,  isn’t it?\\nLook for meaning in the tiniest details to mean more than they do.\\nThe corners of my mouth twitch as my eyes sting. “Kaleb,” I whisper ,\\nbegging.\\nBut it’s Noah who speaks up. “Cici Diggins would say anything for\\nattention.”\\n“She was bleeding,” I clarify . “She didn’ t know I would see her .”\\n“He doesn’ t hit women, Tiernan.” Noah passes me, pulling the\\nibuprofen out of the cabinet. “Unless they’re hysterical and keeping him\\nfrom saving their lives,” he replies, dumping a couple tablets into my hand\\nand meeting my eyes. “Y ou told him to do it.”\\nI stick the pills in my mouth and swallow them dry, feeling them  scratch\\nagainst my throat.\\nYeah, I told him to.\\nThe second time.\\nI told him to hit me, partly because it dulled the pain and partly\\nbecause... I drop my eyes. Partly because I liked it. I liked the anger and the desire\\nto hit him back,  because even though it hurt, I was here. I was in it, and I\\nnever wanted it to stop. I never wanted that feeling to stop.\\nPain always reminds us that we’re alive. And the fear along with it that\\nwe want to stay that way .\\nKaleb is like that. If nothing else, he reminds me that I’m more than I\\nthink I am.\\nBut when he held my face after the slap, and kissed me so softly , my\\nheart immediately sank into my belly , and I for got everything.\\nI forgot why I should keep as far away from him as I can.\\nI run my hand through my hair, chewing on my lip as the alcohol dulls\\nthe pain in my arm.\\n“I want Jake,” I whisper to myself.\\nWhat if this still gets infected? He would know what to do. They can’t\\nhandle this. V olatile, irresponsible…\\n“He’ s not who had your tongue in his mouth minutes ago,” Noah spits\\nout, looking over his shoulder at me as he fills a pitcher . “You liked us\\nthen.”\\nI shift on my feet, looking away .\\nBut he turns, wiping his hands on a towel. “You know , it just occurred\\nto me.” His eyes crinkle as he studies me. “I’m actually the only man in this\\nhouse who hasn’ t hit you,” he states. “And I’m the one you don’t want.\\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you?”\\nI narrow my eyes as his words hit. That’ s not… What?\\nI don’ t…\\n“Maybe if I take you over my knee, too, you’ll get wet?” he asks.\\nAnd then my face falls. He saw us. He saw his father spanking  me that\\nnight.\\nMy heart thumps in my chest, and I watch him shake his head, the first\\nactual sign of disdain I’ve seen come of f Noah, and it’ s directed at me.\\nHe’s pissed now .\\nMy mind goes back to moments ago—Kaleb’ s lips so gentle and Noah’ s\\nmouth so warm.\\nMoments ago, he loved me. I love you. You’re so fucking ours. We love\\nyou.\\nI think he was even crying, because he hated me hurting that much and\\nhated not being able to take the pain away . My arm still throbs, but I feel better than I did.\\nThey took care of me. Not Jake. They handled this.\\nNoah thinks I don’ t see him.\\nHe turns around to fill another pitcher as Kaleb cleans the table, and I\\nstare at them both, barely noticing when the lights go out.\\nThe kitchen goes black, the outdoor lights outside the window dying in\\nthe storm, as well, and the boys stop what they’re doing as the snow falls in\\nthe dark night and the house goes silent.\\nNoah throws a hand towel down. “Jesus, fuck.”\\nKaleb stalks out of the kitchen, heading to the laundry room, and I\\nwatch Noah pull of f his shirt and toss it down as he works the faucet.\\n“All we’ve got left is the hot water in the tank,” he gripes. “Fuck.”\\nI ball my fists, my arms feeling so empty all of a sudden.\\nI take a step, slowly walking up behind Noah.\\nAnd I slide my arms around his waist.\\n“Noah is always warm,” I say in a low voice. “He’ s the one I love to\\ntalk to.”\\nHe stills, and I rest my forehead in his back as my arms wrap around\\nhim and my hands touch his warm torso.\\nI see you.\\n“He’ s the one who smiles at me and always makes me feel like my\\nlungs are full.”\\nThe wind blows through the attic, creaking through the quiet, dark\\nhouse, and he’ s barely breathing.\\n“My arms fit around him perfec tly, and I love to watch him cook. I just\\nwant to stay in the kitchen and watch him all the time.” I smile to myself,\\nbreathing in his scent. “He smell s good enough to eat, and I didn’t want him\\nto leave the shower that day before we went fishing. I wanted him to touch\\nme.”\\nHis chest caves, and I look down to see his fists curl into the wooden\\ncounter .\\nI swallow . “I even fantasized about it,” I whisper . “About us in the\\nshower , hiding in there every morning and keeping our secret.”\\nHe whips around, anger strainin g his face. He grabs me under my arms\\nand lifts me up on my tiptoes.\\nI gasp as he brings us nose to nose. “I was so wet for you on the couch the night of my birthday ,” I whisper\\nbetween us. “So wet.”\\nI do want you.\\nSomething clank s on the floor behind me, and Noah glares down at me,\\nlooking like he’s about to lose his mind. He looks like Kaleb when he looks\\nat me like this.\\nLifting me up, he plops me down in a tin tub, my toes curling into the\\nrusty surface.\\n“Don’ t talk anymore,” he says.\\nIt sounds like a threat, though. I tense.\\n“I have to—”\\n“Shhh.” He releases me, pressi ng his finger to my mouth. All the air\\nrushes out of me.\\nHis eyes pierce,  and I don’t know what he’s going to do, but I know\\nwhat he wants. This Noah kind of scares me.\\nMy thighs clench. I have to go to the bathroom.\\nBut I’m not leaving. I don’ t want to break the spell.\\nKaleb stands off to my side, and all I can see are his legs, because I’m\\ntoo scared to look at his face.\\nI shift on my feet in the tub.\\nThe tin tub , I think to myself.\\nThe pitchers of hot water .\\nThis is a bath.\\nNoah lifts the hem of my shirt, pausing just a moment to give me time\\nto stop him, but I just stare at the floor as he finally lifts it over my head.\\nI hear his intake of breath as the cool air hits my breasts and my shirt\\nfalls to the floor . Kaleb’ s eyes burn my skin from where he stands in the\\ndarkness, and I can barely breathe.\\nYes.\\nThe silvery feeling between legs grows heavier , and I rub my thighs\\ntogether . Slowly , Noah smooths  my hair, parting it on the back,  and I stand\\nthere as he braids it.\\n“Don’ t want to give you a wet head,” he says, strained.\\nMy nipples harden to points as he braids one side and then the other ,\\nKaleb starting to circle me like a shark. I still wear the ribbon I stole from\\nhis room. Noah wraps one of the cheap rubber bands from the drawer around the\\nfinal tail and plays, flipping up my braids. “She’ s cute like this,” he tells\\nKaleb. “Don’ t you think?”\\nThe tails tickle my skin, and I look up in time to see Noah wet his\\nthumb and then rub circles on my left nipple, toying with the sharp, little\\npoint.\\nI groan, crossing my legs against the burn. “I’m gonna pee my pants.”\\n“Then the pants have to go,” he replies calmly .\\nI close my eyes for a moment. I’m not sure if I have to go to the\\nbathroom or I’m just nervous.\\nHe lowers to one knee and looks up at me as he pulls my shorts down. I\\nstep out of them, feeling Kaleb like a threat as he stops and watches.\\nNoah reaches up again, taking my light blue silk panties and pulling\\nthem down my legs, my body bare for them.\\nI look up at Kaleb. He stares, every muscle in his arms flexed with his\\nfists curled as his eyes trail down my body . It doesn’ t look like he’s\\nbreathing.\\nNoah pours water into the tub and then rises, both of them circling me.\\nMy pulse races, and it feels like they’re going to pounce any second.\\nWater sloshes at my ankles, and I hear Noah behind me as Kaleb stops\\nin front of me, running a finger down my torso and stopping just below my\\npanty line. I shiver .\\nA hot cloth hits the back of my neck, and I hear the suds bubble and pop\\nas Noah squeezes the cloth.\\n“Do you mind this, Baby V an der Ber g?”\\nI shake my head , my eyes rollin g into the back of my head. He runs the\\nhot cloth down my back and back up to my shoulders.\\nIt feels so good.\\n“What would you do without us?” Noah leans into my ear , whispering.\\nI lean my head back against him, closing my eyes.\\n“We take care of her pretty good,” he tells Kaleb, reaching around me to\\nsqueeze hot water over my breasts. “She doesn’ t need Daddy . Do you?”\\nKaleb takes my leg, bringing my foot up to rest on his knee as he\\nwashes me. Running the cloth up my thigh, he dips inside, close but not\\nthere, and I moan.\\n“That’ s it.” Noah bites my ear . “Good girl.” Giving me the cloth, he uses his hands and soaps both my breasts,\\nmassaging them  in circles. A pool of heat settles between my legs, and I\\nwant more. I want their hands everywhere.\\nNoah takes my hand with the cloth and pushes it down low. “Clean your\\npussy .”\\nI bite my bottom lip, but I follow directions. Using the cloth, I slip\\nbetween my legs and squeeze it for more soap, washing myself.\\nKaleb brings up my other leg, bathing me, but his eyes are on my hand,\\nwatching me soap up my bare pussy .\\n“Get it wet again?” I ask him, holding out the cloth.\\nHe dips it into the water and hands it back to me, his chest rising and\\nfalling hard as he watches me wash myself and water drip down my legs.\\nHis hard eyes don’t blink, and a groan escapes him. I look down, seeing\\nhis cock straining against his jeans.\\n“Is it clean?” Noah asks.\\nFor a moment, I think he’s asking me until Kaleb dives in, his hot\\ntongue licking the length of my slit to check.\\nI shudder . Fuck.\\nI grab Kaleb’ s head, keeping him there, and Noah twists mine to the\\nside, taking my mouth.\\nKaleb licks and sucks, while  Noah takes my breath, making it\\nimpossible to breathe.\\nGod, don’ t stop.\\n“Say yes to us,” Noah whispers against my mouth.\\nI stare up at him, quiet for a moment.\\nIf we do this, we might not be able to come back from it. I don’t want to\\nlose them. I…\\nKaleb’ s mouth works its way inside, and I thread my fingers through his\\nhair as he licks and sucks my clit.\\nNoah jostles my chin. “Open your mouth, T iernan,” he orders.\\nI do and he sinks his tongue inside, his kiss tingling all the way down to\\nmy toes.\\n“Say yes to us,” he says again.\\nKaleb comes back in, grabbing my ass in both hands and yanking me\\ninto him. His mouth covers my pussy .\\nI whimper . “Yes,” I pant. “Y es.”\\nNoah releases me and growls, “Fuck, yeah.” Kaleb rises, lifts me up by the backs of my thighs, and I wrap my\\ndripping arms and legs around him, meeting his eyes.\\nMine.\\nIn a few months, the snow will melt, and the world will invade us again,\\nbut right now…they’re mine. For this one winter , they’r e mine.\\nOur noses touch , and Kaleb opens his mouth like he’s going  to say\\nsomething, but then he just kisses my forehead.\\nFlutters go of f in my stomach. I love it when he does that.\\nHe turns, carrying us to bed.\\nI hug him to me, watching Noah follow us through the dark house, and I\\nbury my nose in Kaleb’ s neck, inhaling him.\\nI want this. I want them. I want him.\\nKaleb is a bully  and a baby , but so am I, and I want him to talk to me,\\nbut sometimes I think he already does, and I just don’t hear. The tight way\\nhis arm is aroun d my waist. How safe I feel with his other hand holding my\\nhead in the crook of his neck.\\nThe way he smells my hair and pulls me out of harm’ s way, even when I\\nthink I barely exist to him. He always knows what’ s happening and where I\\nam.\\nTears burn my eyes as I think of the last few months. Giving  me his\\nmeat at dinner , giving me his lap when my seat was wet, and taking me\\naway from Cici and Terrance on the dance floor . He’s always  thinking of\\nme.\\nThat’ s how he talks to me.\\n“Kaleb,” I whisper in his ear, trailing kisses down from his temp le to his\\njaw to his neck.\\nHe exhales and lifts me up higher , gripping my ass as we reach the\\nsecond floor. I look down at him, our lips almost touching. He opens the\\ndoor, Noah squeezing past, because Kaleb and I are lost in each other for a\\nmoment.\\nThe door at the top of the stairs creaks open, and I can hear Noah\\nbreathing from here.\\n“Get her ass up here,” he breathes out. “I’m dying.”\\nI dart out my tongue, licking Kaleb’ s lip, before sinking into his mouth.\\nI move over his lips, nibbling and tasting, as he closes the bottom door and\\nclimbs the steps up to his bedroom. My heart swells, and I almost want to\\nlaugh or cry , because there’ s too much going on inside me. We reach the top, that door closing, too. The fire burns, and the air is\\nwarm, Kaleb’ s smell making my skin hum.\\nMy pussy clenches, feeling his big bed looming behind me.\\nI start to lower my feet to the floor , but all of a sudden, Noah wraps his\\narms around my torso and pulls  me back into him instead. My toes touch\\nthe hardwood floor , and I stare at Kaleb as his brother whispers in my ear .\\n“He could be gone days,” he says, reaching around and pinching my clit\\nbetween his fingers. “Days, T iernan.”\\nI arch my back, the little pain and the promise of what they could do to\\nme in their father ’s absence sending a shockwave through my body .\\nFuck, yes.\\nThe pain in my arm is gone, and I can’t feel anything other than my\\nheart beat right now .\\nBreaking away , I stumble backward, my lungs getting smaller . I can’t\\nget enough air. They face me, slowly stalking toward me, Kaleb rubbing his\\ncock through his jeans.\\nThe backs of my knees hit the bed, and I fall to my ass, hitting the\\nsheets.\\nCrawling back, I move over the bed on my hands and knees, watching\\nthem come for me.\\n“We took care of you,” Noah says, quirking a smile as he rubs himself\\nthrough his jeans, too. “Now , take care of us.”\\nHe rushes me, coming in, catching me, and cupping my face as both of\\nus fall to the bed.\\nI land on my back, my head hitting the pillow as Noah lies at my side.\\n“Noah…” I let out a small cry .\\n“Shhhh.”\\n“I’m scared,” I whisper .\\nKaleb circles the bed, watching as Noah strokes my hair .\\nHe threa ds my braid through his fingers. “We’re going to fuck you,\\nbaby .”\\nHis hand dips between my legs, and Kaleb grabs my ankle, pulling my\\nthighs apart.\\nNoah sinks two fingers inside me, and I gasp as they slip in easily , wet\\nas I am.\\nNoah’ s lips find mine, and he kisses as he pumps his fingers  slowly .\\n“Wider, baby ,” he begs. I spread both thighs wider as his tongue moves in my mouth and then\\nmoves to my breasts, sucking and biting my nipple.\\nI look up at Kaleb as I move into his brother ’s hand, seeking his fingers\\nout and wanting to move at my pace.\\n“Goddamn,” Noah grits out. “Man, she’ s tight.”\\nHe fills me, but I want him deeper . I’m craving more, his body , his\\nmuscles, I want it all fucking me.\\n“Don’ t stop,” I groan. God, he feels good.\\nBut more. I need more.\\nI take his face, bringing his mouth to mine, and he keeps fingering me\\nas his mouth moves over mine, teasing me down to my belly .\\nSomething knoc ks him, breaking the kiss, and before I can open my\\neyes, Kaleb’s lips are on mine, kissing me hard from above. Noah sinks into\\nmy neck, kissing behind my ear, and I grapple for Kaleb’ s belt, trying to\\nunfasten it.\\nHe stops me, though, and I open my eyes to see him rise off the bed and\\nundo it himself.\\nNoah follows, standing up and dropping his pants, his belt hitting the\\nfloor . He pauses a moment, staring down at me, and my pussy wants his\\nfingers back. Or something.\\nI drop my eyes, seeing his cock sticking straight out like a steel rod, and\\nI shoot up, the ribbon still in my hair dangling over my temple.\\nI open my mouth, wanting to taste him.\\nBut he pushes me back down, coming down on top of me, and pulling\\nthe sheet over us.\\n“I’m first,” he growls over my mouth. He reaches over, and I hear the\\ndrawer open as he takes something out.\\nHis dick nudges my pussy , and I grind into it, so fucking ready  to have\\nhim inside me.\\n“Tiernan, stop that.” He bares his teeth, frustrated, and tears the condom\\nopen before reaching down and slipping it on.\\nI kiss his jaw a million times, wrapping my arms around him and then\\ndragging his bottom lip out between my teeth.\\nHe fits his cock at my entrance, rises up to look down at me, and grabs\\nmy hip, thrusting himself inside.\\nI stretch, tight around his cock, and squeeze my eyes shut as he hits my\\nspot deep. I whimper . “Jesus Christ,” he groans, his face twisted in pain. He breathes hard and\\nfast as he pulls out and thrusts back in. “She’ s so damn tight. Jesus.”\\nI hold his hips, dragging my nails over his skin as I spread my thighs\\nwider .\\nNoah is always warm. He’s the one who smiles at me and always makes\\nme feel like my lungs ar e full.\\n“You feel so good,” I say quietly . “Don’ t stop, Noah.”\\nHe smiles and comes down, squeezing a breast as he starts to pump his\\nhips, faster and harder .\\n“You keep talking, and I’ll come too soon,” he tells me, amusement in\\nhis voice.\\nI seek his lips and take them with mine, kissing him slow and deep as\\nwe fuck in his brother ’s bed. Sliding out, he thrusts quickly back inside me,\\nand I squeeze his hips, guiding  him and rolling my hips into him to meet\\neach move.\\nI moan as we kiss, the world around me spinning. His hand moves over\\nmy body , touching me everywhere, and his mouth grazes my forehead.\\n“Such a good girl, Tiernan,” he whispers as his lips dip to suck on my\\nnipples next. I hold his head to me, his words making me want to smile. He\\nknows I’m not a good girl.\\nI’m a bad one. But I’m their bad one.\\nI moan, arching my back for his mouth and how good his dick feels.\\nHe come s back up, thrusting harder and my pussy clenching around him\\nas my or gasm crests.\\n“We’re so fucki ng lucky ,” he gasps, kissing my nose and lips. “Such a\\nsweet little cunt.”\\nI moan, both of us moving in sync as our pace quickens and I start to\\ncome.\\nBut then I look up, seeing Kaleb.\\nMy body stills, but Noah keeps going, barely noticing.\\nKaleb stands in the dark corner , his jeans unfastened but still on as he\\nwatches me. I hold onto Noah as my body moves up and down the mattress\\nwith his thrusts, Kaleb’ s eyes on me turning me on even more. My pussy\\ncontracts, I don’t blink, and my body tenses, every muscle tightening as I\\ncome.\\nI cry out, looking at Kaleb as I shudder and shake, struggling for breath.\\nThe orgasm rocks through me, his eyes not faltering as his brother fucks me, and my pussy warms as I grow wetter . I want to know what he’s\\nthinking. I want him to know what this means to me, and loving them is the\\nonly time I feel brave.\\nI flip Noah and me over , pinning him on his back as I straddle him.\\nNow it’ s Kaleb’ s turn.\\nNoah sucks in air through his teeth, grappling for my body , but I don’t\\nstay there. Spinning around, I give him my ass and look over my shoulder\\nat Kaleb, so he can watch.\\nI reach underneath me, fit Noah back inside, and lower myself onto him\\nagain.\\nSlowly , I roll my hips, looking back at him still standing in the corner as\\nI ride his brother . Noah’ s cock slips in and out, and he fists my ass in both\\nhis hands, grunting.\\n“Fuck, T iernan,” he groans.\\nHe bends his knees up, so I can lean into them while I move, but I hold\\nKaleb’ s eyes.\\nI want to see you happy .\\nI take out my braids, leaving just the ribbon, and his gaze trails down\\nmy back to my ass as it moves, rolling in and out on top of another man.\\nI crook my finger .\\nAnd I swear I see a small smile.\\nHe comes over, and I point to the space on the bed in front of me.\\nFiguring out what I mean, he walks to the end of the mattress and drops his\\njeans, climbing onto the bed and kneeling at the end.\\nI look down, my heart skipping a beat and my mouth going dry as I take\\nhim in. I didn’ t get much of a view that day in the barn.\\nFucking Noah, I lean forward and take Kaleb in my mouth, his long,\\nthick muscle hard as a rock. I fist the base, because I can’t take it all, and\\nsuck him slow and gentle, licking and teasing with my tongue.\\nHe threa ds his fingers through my hair, and I rock on Noah, our moans\\nfilling the room  as the winter rages outside. Using my good arm to prop\\nmyself up, I stroke him softly as I trail kisses up his abs, reveling in his\\nsmooth, tight skin and his taste.\\nDiving back down, I sink my mouth down him farther and farther ,\\nfeeling him tap the back of my throat. He jerks, a strangled groan leaving\\nhis throat. I move up and down him, rolling my ass for Noah as I suck on Kaleb,\\nevery once in a while stopping to suck on his tip, tasting a little of his cum.\\nNoah digs his fingers into my hips, pumping me from the botto m, and I\\nknow he’s about  to come. But Kaleb grabs me and pulls me off his straining\\ncock, kissing my mouth fierce and hard. He climbs off the bed, pulling me\\nwith him, and shoves me back at the bed, facing Noah this time.\\nI narrow my eyes, not understanding. What?\\nHe pushes into me from behind, forcing me back on the bed, and I\\nclimb on his brother , regular cowgirl this time. I slide back onto Noah,\\nKaleb pushing me forward onto his brother ’s body . I stop breathing for a\\nmoment. What is he…?\\nThen, I feel it.\\nHim, behind me. Between our legs, his fingers press into my…other\\nplace.\\nI tense up.\\nUhh… I’m down with a lot, but I don’ t think this is…a good idea.\\nKaleb pulls me up and turns my face to him, guiding my hips. I move\\non Noah, holding Kaleb’ s eyes as he taunts my ass, working the tip of his\\nfinger inside me.\\nI swallow , tightening up, but he moves my hand to my pussy , telling me\\nto prime myself.\\nI rub my clit in soft, slow circles, and that’s where we stay for a minute.\\nNoah pawing my tits as I play with myself and Kaleb’ s finger rests inside\\nme. Slowly , I relax.\\nAnd after a couple minutes, I start backing up into it, my orgasm\\nbuilding again.\\nHis finger feels good. It feels bad, but in all the good ways.\\nGently , he pushe s me forward, and I dive into Noah’ s mouth, moving up\\nand down on his cock.\\nKaleb’ s dick presses into me, crowning me, and I let out a long breath,\\nmoving into it as he pushes just inside.\\nLiquid fire courses through me, and I suck in air through my teeth as he\\nslides in very slowly . Breath by breath, he sinks deeper inside, and I take it\\nslowly , adjusting and relaxing.\\n“Good girl,” Noah says. “I warned you.”\\nI breathe out a weak laugh. Yeah, you did.\\nHe told me Kaleb wanted it this way . My body accepts them both, and slowly , we start to move. Noah cups\\none breast and holds my neck with the other hand, while Kale b takes the\\nother breast and grips my hip. I roll down Noah, taking Kaleb  inside and\\nsway back, sliding Kaleb out as I take Noah in.\\nI close my eyes, arching my back and jutting out my ass for Kaleb.\\nKaleb thrusts into me, our pace quickly speeding up, and after a moment,\\nthe boys  are doing all the work. Noah fucks me from the bottom, while\\nKaleb slams into my ass again and again, everything filled, and my body on\\nfire.\\n“You like it?” Noah asks.\\nI nod, delirious with pleasure. “Y eah.”\\nKaleb fucks my ass but brings me up to kiss him, everything about his\\nlips soft and sweet.\\nHe looks at me, both boys not letting up as they take what they want.\\nBut for me, time stands still.\\nHis gaze holds mine as he caresses my face, and I feel like he wants to\\nsay so much, but he won’ t. I feel it, though.\\nI feel safe.\\n“Kaleb,” I mouth over his lips. “Do this again to me tomorrow?”\\nHe nods and buries his mouth in my neck. I smile.\\nThey massage my breasts, and I struggle to keep my moans in check.\\nGod, what is Jake going to say? Or do?\\n“Our little secre t,” Noah says, coming up to suck on my nipple. “Our\\nsweet little secret.”\\nI kiss Kaleb as Noah kisses me, and I hold his head to my body , loving\\nhis tongue on my flesh.\\nSkin on skin fills the room as my ass slaps into Kaleb, and Noah tenses\\nunder me, groaning.\\nI drag my nails up my thighs as Noah thrusts into me and comes, and\\nKaleb holds my face to him, staring hard at me as we fuck.\\nI tighten around him, feeling my or gasm coming again, and I rub my clit\\nto help it along.\\nMy body warm s, my nerves firing inside me as the sensation  of both\\nholes filled drives me over the edge. I scream, coming as Kaleb grips my\\nhair and thrusts into me harder , burying himself to the hilt.\\n“Oh, God!” I cry out. My breasts bob as he rides my ass, and I can’t take anymore. I fall\\nforward, the only thing keeping me up is him holding my hair .\\nHe grunts, lets out short breaths,  and punches hard, gasping for air as he\\nspills inside of me.\\n“God,” I gasp, shaking.\\nSweat trickles down my back, and Kaleb releases me, letting me fall\\nonto Noah. Our wet bodies stick, but I don’t care. Noah wraps his arms\\naround me as Kaleb tries to calm down behind me, his hand pressing into\\nmy lower back.\\nI close my eyes, sated and high. I have no idea what tomorrow brings,\\nbut I can’t bring myself to care. I’m exactly where I want to be, and for\\ntonight, at least, I’m staying.\\nL.A. and my life there once upon a time is a million miles away . This is\\nmy home.\\nA while later, the fire crackles as Noah sleeps soundly , and Kaleb holds\\nme to his body . I drift in and out, hearing the wind blow , but I’m warm and\\nsafe inside.\\nSomething tugs at my hair ever so gently , and I vaguely register soft silk\\ndragging over my forehead. I blink my eyes open to see Kaleb fist my red\\nribbon in his hand and reach under his head, stuffing it back inside his\\npillow-case.\\nI smile, holding back my laugh, and go back to sleep.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI wake up, the morning light falling across my face, and jerk, squeezing my\\neyes shut again as I turn over .\\nBut as I roll onto my left arm, pain shoots down to my fingertips and\\neverything comes flooding back all at once. I groan, shooting up in bed.\\nThe sheet falls to my waist as I look around the room—Kaleb’ s room—\\nand I see that I’m alone.\\nI look down at my bandaged arm, seeing blood seeping through. God,\\nwhat was I thinking last night?\\nAn ache rocks through my head, and I flinch, rubbing the back of my\\nneck. After the fire and the injury , I decided to lose my mind and…\\nImages flash of the three of us, and I shake my head clear . I can’ t face it.\\nNot yet. Not that I didn’ t absolutely love everything that happened in here\\nlast night, but I shouldn’ t have done it.\\nJesus. I stumble out of the bed, my legs weak as I grab for the first piece\\nof cloth ing I find on the floor . I need some ibuprofen and a shower . My\\nentire body is on fire.\\nThe time on the clock on the bedside table flashes two-sixteen a.m., but\\nI know it’s later than that. They must’ve gotten the electricity working\\nagain. Thank goodness.\\nI slip on the black T-shirt, Kaleb’ s scent wafting over me, and\\ngoosebumps spread down my legs, remembering how good he felt.\\nAnd for a moment I’m almost lost again. My heart aches a little, still\\nfeeling his eyes. His mouth. His arms. Something starts beeping from outside, and I blink, hearing the digger .\\nIt makes that sound when it’s put in reverse. They must be dealing with the\\ndamage.\\nI leave the room, heading downstairs, and I glance through Noah’ s open\\ndoor as I head into the bathroom. His room is empty . It’s unlike him to be\\nup and doing chores at this time of day, willingly at least. He must be pretty\\nscared of his father .\\nHow did the fire start? Now that I have a clear head, it doesn’ t make\\nsense. They’ve lived up here their whole lives. Jake taught them how to be\\ndiligent in turning of f machinery and not leaving fires to burn unattended.\\nI step softly into the bathroom  and reach behind the shower curtain,\\nturning on the water. It must be something we didn’ t realize was a problem.\\nLike Noah said, something electrical, maybe.\\nLeaning against  the sink, I lift my arm a little, whimpering as it aches.\\nThe muscles are tight, and I look down at it, starting to unwrap the gauze.\\nBut I hear steps enter the bathroom, and I look up, seeing  Kaleb.\\nShowered, shaved, dressed in clean jeans and a navy-blue T-shirt, and my\\ncheeks warm, thinking about how I loved everything about him last night.\\nAnd here I am, dirty, hair hang ing in my face, and a night’ s worth of\\nblood and sweat on me. Not just my sweat, either .\\nHe carries the red tin and comes over, setting it down and pushing my\\nhair back, inspecting my face. My skin warms at his touch, and as he turns\\nmy head , caress ing my cheek, it takes me a minute to figure out what he’s\\ndoing.\\nThe slaps. He’ s making sure I’m not bruised.\\nI stare at his mouth, wishing I could’ve heard his voice last night. I\\nalmost thought I did a couple times.\\nI reach up, touching his cheek, too, starting to believe I imagined\\neverything I felt coming off him last night, but… he turns away , pulling\\nback a little.\\nMy hand stays there, suspended as he drops his own and starts\\nrummaging through the tin.\\nTears springs to my eyes. The old Kaleb is back.\\n“Kaleb…” I murmur .\\nHe doesn’t make  eye contact—his eyes narrowed as he removes the rest\\nof the old bandages and starts cleaning the stitches. “I don’t know what you were saying last night,” I tell him. “But I felt\\nit.”\\nHe sits me down on the edge of the tub and squats down, wrapping a\\nnew bandage around my arm.\\nI stare at him, the shame starting to creep in when he won’ t look at me.\\nIt didn’ t feel bad last night. I didn’ t feel the shame then.\\nNow , he’s probably wondering what schedule the slut is on. Who gets\\nme on Thursdays? On Tuesdays? Do we meet in my bed or do I come to\\nyours?\\nI try to swallow through my dry mouth, tears welling. “I felt it,” I\\nwhisper again.\\nI felt him and how it was perfect and how I wanted him to fold me up\\ninside him forever . It was a perfect moment when all of me aligned for one\\nfucking instant, and I felt full and strong. Those moments are rare.\\nHis lips twitch, his hands slowing, but then he finds his focus again,\\nsecuring the bandage around my arm.\\nI reach out.\\nSlowly , I lift my right arm, almost like I’m holding out my hand for a\\ndog to snif f when I greet it.\\nI feel him still as the back of my hand glides up his face, and I hold my\\nbreath.\\nI just want to know it was real. I was his in those moments.\\nFinally , he closes his eyes, exhales, and leans into my hand, giving in.\\nA lump lodges in my throat, but I hold back the tears as I caress his\\ntemple.\\n“I don’t want to fight with you anymore,” I tell him. “I’ll leave, okay?\\nYou don’ t have to fear me.”\\nHis eyes open, his brows etched with pain, but he doesn’ t look at me.\\n“I’ll leave. I won’t ruin this home for you. I won’ t hurt you,” I whisper .\\n“I promise I’ll leave.”\\nJust let us have this time.\\nHe shakes his head, and I don’t know what he’s trying to say now, but\\njust when I think he’s going to jump to his feet and leave, his head falls,\\nsinking into my lap.\\nI still, looking down at him. His black hair that’s not really black now\\nthat I can be close enough to him to see it’s a shade above.  The tattoo stretching from under his ear and going down his neck vertically , but even\\nthis close, the cursive is still too fine to read.\\nIt doesn’ t matter . Kaleb has things to say. He just doesn’ t need everyone\\nto hear .\\nSitting there, I grip the edge of the tub, something in my chest feeling\\nlike it’ s splintering apart as he struggles for air with his head bowed.\\nHe blurs in front of me as my eyes fill with tears. It’s not going to be\\neasy to leave ...them.\\nI swallow . A feeling, not a place.\\nLoving them has made something inside me wake up, and I don’t want\\nto go back to being who I was. I might wish this change could’v e happened\\ndifferently , but some of us don’ t learn from the heat. W e need the fire.\\nReaching out, I glide my hands down his back and bend over, wrapping\\nmy arms around him.\\nI squeeze my eyes shut, savoring this.\\nBut just then I hear heavy footfalls run up the stairs and a shadow falls\\nacross the bathroom.\\n“What the fuck happened?” someone yells.\\nI pop my eyes open. Jake.\\nI sniffle, drying my eyes as I sit up but avoid his gaze as he looms at the\\ndoor. Kaleb rises and backs away from me.\\nWhat the hell is Jake doing back already? What do I tell him?\\nBut he doesn’ t seem to notice that Kaleb and I were embracing.\\nHe rushe s over. “Jesus Christ…” He takes my arm, gently lifting it up to\\ninspect the bandage and then diving down to swipe the bloody one off the\\nfloor .\\n“It’s okay ,” I assure him.\\nHe shoots Kaleb a glare anyway . “I leave you alone for one night!”\\nKaleb returns the look, and my stomach immediately sinks. God, they\\nlook alike when they’re angry .\\nBut then Kaleb quirks a smile, and I’m not sure why, but it pisses Jake\\noff more, and he jerks his head, ordering his son out.\\nKaleb leaves, not sparing me another glance.\\n“It’s okay ,” I tell him again once Kaleb is gone. “The animals are fine.\\nI’m fine.”\\nJake slams the door and comes  over, kneeling down in Kaleb’ s place\\nand unwrapping the bandage to take a look. His cheeks and nose are wind- burnt, and the scruf f on his jaw is a little darker than the hair on his head.\\n“A fire started in the middle of the night,” I tell him. “Thank goodness\\nwe woke up. We were able to extinguish it, but I got roughed  up when I\\ntried to get Shawnee out of the barn. It wasn’ t the boys’ fault.”\\nHe tosse s the bandage and inspects the stitches. “Jesus Christ,” he bites\\nout. “Goddamn them.”\\n“They didn’ t do this,” I say . “They took care of it, though.”\\nHe shakes his head, continuing  to look at the wound. Rising up, he\\ngrabs a washclo th off the shelf and wets it, while also taking the petroleum\\njelly out of the medicine cabinet.\\nI look up at him, worry coiling its way through my stomach. “You’re\\nback early .”\\nIf he’d showed up ten minutes ago, he would’ve found me in Kaleb’ s\\nbed.\\nIf he’d come back last night, he…\\nIt’s not somethin g I planned on hiding from him, but I don’t want him\\nthinking we reveled in his absence either or that this was planned.\\n“I got turned around,” he tells me, setting the items down and spilling a\\ncouple ibuprofen into his palm and handing them to me. “The snow was\\njust too deep and the wind too strong. I wasn’ t going to make it another\\nnight out there.”\\nHe comes down , dropping to one knee, and cleans around the stitches,\\nadding some petroleum jelly as I swallow the pills.\\nI stare at him, his lips a foot away as he dresses my wound. “Something\\nelse happened last night,” I whisper .\\nHe slows for a moment but then continues, not looking at me.\\n“After the fire…” I go on. “W ith the boys.”\\nI don’t blink and neither does he as he avoids my gaze. My stomach\\nchurns.\\n“I…”\\n“Both of them?” he asks, looking down to pick up some gauze he\\ndropped on the floor .\\n“I…um…”\\nI can’ t say it, though, and he doesn’ t make me.\\nHis lips tighten as he wraps my arm. “W ere they good to you?”\\nMy eyes water , and I nod. He’s not yelling. I’m not sure if I’m hurt that\\nhe’s not jealous, or thankful he’ s not disgusted with me. But he is jealous. His hard expression and clipped words tell me that.\\nI open my mouth to explain. I love him, but I…\\nI don’ t know .\\nI drop my head. I have no idea how to explain any of this. Or what I feel\\nwith them.\\nIt just never feels wrong. That’ s all I know .\\nIt’s felt wrong before. Not here, though. Not with them.\\n“I—”\\n“Did you finish those college applications yet?” he asks, cutting me of f.\\nI blink, falling silent.\\nHuh?\\nCollege applications…\\nSo that’ s it? He’ s not going to make this harder?\\nI search for my words, taking the easy way out he’s giving me. “What,\\nare you trying to get rid of me?” I tease.\\n“Well, you’re no use as a cook anymore with one arm.”\\nI chuckle, relief washing over me as I shake my head.\\nAnd then I dive in, wrapping my arms around his neck and hugging\\nhim. He freezes for a moment but then relaxes, embracing me back as he\\npulls us to our feet.\\nThank you.\\n“You okay now?” He pulls his head up and looks down at me. “Or do\\nyou need help with the shower?”\\nHe gestures to the running shower , now hot and filling the bathroom\\nwith steam.\\n“I’m okay .”\\nI can wash my hair with one hand, I guess.\\nI scratch my head, overwhelmed . I have no idea what happens with the\\nthree of them when I leave this bathroom.\\nBut nothing has to happen unless I want it to. There’ s always that.\\nIt can all end now .\\nI strip off my shirt, and he takes my hand, holding me steady as he helps\\nme in to the shower . I go to pull the curtain closed, but I meet his eyes, and\\nI can see the look there as he stares back. The one where he’s thinking of\\nclimbing in with me.\\nBut as I watch the temptation play across his eyes, I finally watch as he\\njust sighs, shake s his head, and rolls his eyes, yanking the curtain closed between us.\\nIn a moment, the bathroom door opens and slams shut again, and I smile\\nto myself. Thank goodness he made that easy .\\nOne thing is for certain, though. T oo much of a good thing is dangerous.\\nI’m sleeping alone tonight.\\n \\n \\n“Move the horses into the paddock and start clearing the debris.”\\n“Already done,” I hear Noah tell his father as I descend the stairs. “I’m\\nraking out the stalls now. Oh, and Henderson emailed about his order , so\\njust go deal with the new specs, and I’ll take care of the barn.”\\nI enter the kitchen, seeing Noah pull a small plate out of the microwave\\nas I circle the island toward the sink for some water .\\nHe sets the plate down on the counter , his eyes falling to my arm. “Is it\\nokay?”\\nI fill up a glass and nod, tossing him a half smile. “It’ s okay .”\\nA little better after my shower and the ibuprofen, actually . The heat\\ncured most of my body aches.\\nHe stares down at me, a slight smile playing on his lips, and flutters fill\\nmy stomach, making me lose my breath. He did exactly what he said he\\nwas going to do last night. He made love to me. He kissed me so much.\\nHe kissed me so much last night . My cheeks warm, remembering.\\nHe pushes the plate toward me, smirking like he knows exactly what\\nI’m thinking. “Y our muf fin’s warmed.”\\nI cock an eyebr ow and grab the muffin off the plate, taking my glass\\nand walking away . I hear his snort behind me.\\nSetting my plate on the island, I take a bite as Noah leaves. The sweet\\ntaste makes my mouth water . I ate at dinner last night, but I’m starving like\\nI haven’ t eaten in days.\\nI look up, seeing  Jake’ s eyebrows furrowed as he stares at the door that\\nNoah just left through.\\n“What’ s wrong?”\\nJake blinks, shaking his head. “He’ s helping,” he replies. “W illingly .”\\nHe walks to the coffee pot and pours a cup as I drop my head, so he\\ncan’t see my smile. “And the coffee’s already made,” he adds, staring at the pot with a\\npuzzled look.\\nI take another bite. Happy people are more agreeable. I know that much.\\nNoah is responsible today , because he’ s happy today .\\n“Aren’ t you cold?” I hear Jake ask.\\nI look over, seeing him stare at my bare arm, because I’m wearing a\\ntank top with only one arm insid e my sweater . The other side is tucked over\\nmy shoulder .\\n“The sleeve chafes me.” I tuck my hair behind my ear and take another\\nbite.\\nHe approaches. “You should stay in bed. You shouldn’ t be up walking\\naround. W e can handle everything.”\\n“I don’ t want to stay in bed.”\\nI thought about it. If for no other reason than to catch up on some sleep,\\nbut…\\nI don’ t want to be in my room. I don’ t want to be where they’re not.\\nI slow my chewing. It’s going to hurt to leave when the snow melts,\\nisn’t it? I miss them when I’m not around them. What’ s it going to be like\\nbeing in a different state when I don’t even want to be in another room\\nwithout them?\\n“Did you draw these?”\\nHuh? I come back to reality and turn, following his gaze. Both doors of\\nthe refrigerator are plastered with my sketches for the re-design s I’m doing\\non the furniture. I straighten my spine and walk toward the fridge, confused.\\nI thought I threw these away .\\nWrinkles cover one of the pieces of the butcher paper , because it was\\nthrown in the trash and dug out. The other sketches I slid unde r the couch\\nwhen I finished working the other day in the living room and wanted them\\nout of the way .\\nNow they’re hanging up.\\nIt only takes a moment to realize who put them there. I turn my head,\\nseeing Kaleb throw a saddle over his shoulder and lead Shawne e back into\\nthe stable. I smile to myself.\\n“They’re good,” Jake says. “Can’ t wait to see the finished product.”\\nI’m not sure how much I’ll get done with one arm, but I’m excited to\\nget back  in the shop. Jake takes his mug and starts to leave the kitchen, but\\nthen he turns and looks at me, suddenly serious. “I don’t want you venturing off the property ,” he tells me. “And don’t\\ngo outside at night, okay?”\\n“Why?” He’ s trained me how to deal with wild animals.\\nBut he tells me, “The fire starte d in the loft. There’ s nothing there that\\nwould’ve caused it.”\\nI stare at him. So… It wasn’ t electrical or something the boys did?\\nWhat…\\nAnd then it hits me. The fire was set on purpose?\\n“I thought you said no one could get up here,” I say\\n“No.” He shakes his head. “I said the roads were closed.”\\nHe leaves the room, and I gape  after him. He’s not serious. Someone\\nelse could’ve been here last night?\\n \\n \\nI adjust the spray gun, turning the dial on the gun to a lower setting, and\\nstand back, spraying a light dusting of gold paint over the most pronounced\\nparts of the blue, violet, and green dresser . I graze the perimeter of the top,\\nas well as the legs and the four corners.\\nTurning the gun off, I set it down and pull off my mask and eyewear .\\nThe blue and violet melt into each other , and I love how the blue drips into\\nthe green. The gold gives it a sheen, and once the handles are back on, I\\nthink it’ll look amazing.\\nI smile. I like it.\\nRemoving the sling Jake had me put my arm in, I look down at the\\nbandage, not seeing any blood seeping through. I don’t really need the\\nsling, especially since it was my left arm injured, and I’ve been  doing fine\\nwith just my right hand today , but Jake was right. Keeping it immobile\\nhelped with the pain.\\nI pop two aspir in with a drink of water and pass Noah and Jake as I\\nwalk back into the house.\\nWashing my hands, I look out the window , seeing the snow-drenched\\nbranches and needles, a light wind kicking up the powder on the rock cliffs\\naround the barn and stable. From this view , the barn looks fine. I can’t see\\nthe other side and the whole corner burnt out. Thank goodness most of it is\\nstill useable. The boys spent the morning cleaning out the rubble and patching up what they could with the supplies we had on hand before laying\\ndown fresh hay .\\nThe red light on my phone lights up as I dry my hands, and I turn it on\\nto see a missed call from Mirai. I let out a sigh.\\nIf I talk to her, what should I lead with? How I was injured by falling\\ndebris in a barn fire or how we were in a police chase or how I’ll be lucky\\nto make it out of here next summer not pregnant?\\nNo. I’m not ready to let the world in.\\nI ignore the call.\\nBut I catch sight of the date on my phone and do a double take. It’s\\nalmost December . Christmas.\\nAll of a sudden , I glance outsi de and see the trees that surround us.\\nThey look just like Christmas trees. I lean over the sink to check them out. I\\ndoubt Jake ever did much decorating when the boys were kids, but I’m sure\\nhe put a tree up. He’ s not a Grinch.\\nAnd I’m sure he shopped for a tree right in his own backyard.\\nPushing off the counter , I almost leap to the closet, grabbing my coat,\\nhat, and gloves. I slip everything on quickly and then kick off my sneakers\\nand slip my feet into my boots. Wrapping my scarf around my neck, I race\\nthrough the kitchen and into the shop, grabbing a pair of cutters off the tool\\nrack and stepping outside before Jake or Noah can pull their heads out of\\nthe bikes to ask me questions.\\nThe cold nips at my cheeks and nose, but the clouds are rolling in,\\npromising more  snow , and something can’t keep the smile off my face. I\\nstep through the snow , knee deep as I climb the small incline between the\\nstable and the shop toward the most perfect tree laying ahead.  I noticed it\\nmonths ago, but with the snow on it, it’s even more beautiful . It’s fifteen\\nfeet tall and full around the bottom as it grows into a sharp point at the top,\\nperfect shape for a topper .\\nBut I’m not cutting it down. And I won’ t ask Jake to. No, it would be a\\nshame.\\nI do need some fringe of f it, though. It has plenty .\\nWalking up, I curl my toes in the boots against the cold snow that\\nslipped in and bat at the branches, dusting of f the snow .\\nI lean in, closing my eyes.\\nThe scent of the pine and snow smells like Narnia and Christmas. I can\\nalmost smell the wrapping paper . I reach out with my cutters and take one of the twigs attached to a\\nbough. I squeeze the handle, prying the small branch left and right, but it’s\\nfrozen.\\nThe crisp snow falls of f a branch and lands on a sliver of my wrist, and I\\ncan almost taste the silvery flavor in the air. I pull at the twig,  twisting it,\\nbut then suddenly someone reaches around me and slices the twig off in one\\nswift motion.\\nI jerk my head, seeing Kaleb looking down at me. The hesitan ce that’s\\nusually present in his eyes is gone, replaced with calm. He hands me the\\ntwig, and I take it.\\n“I wanted to make something for the house,” I say quietly .\\nBut he doesn’ t reply , of course. Kaleb doesn’ t care what I’m doing or\\nwhy.\\nReaching out, he slices off another twig, the needles spreading their\\nsnow all over my boots as he holds the branch out to me.\\nI nod, taking it. I open my mouth to say thank you, but I stop myself.\\nInstead, I meet his eyes and tell him with a small smile. Without  waiting for\\nhim to walk away , I point to another one, and he reaches around me with\\nboth arms, cutting off the twig and laying it in my arms. I reach up, pointing\\nto a higher branch, and he stretches above my head, working his blade\\nagain.\\nWe move around the tree, picki ng nice, long twigs with dense needles,\\nand I’m not sure how long our little truce will last, but I’m sure it will last\\nlonger the more I don’ t talk.\\nThe next branch breaks off, the snow on it sprinkling over me and\\nlanding on my eyelashes and nose. A glob lands right on my cheek, and I\\nwince, shaking my head and brushing off my face. I smile, but I don’t\\nlaugh. I don’t make any sound. When I look up, Kaleb is watching me with\\nan amused tilt to his lips.\\nI take the branch and whip it at him, his head jerking away to avoid the\\nflurries, but I catch his grin.\\nMy own falls, a sting hitting the back of my eyes as I stare  at him.\\nThat’ s the first time I’ve seen that. Something like happiness on his face.\\nHe meet s my gaze, and I quickly  blink away the tears, not sure what the\\nhell is wrong with me. It’ s only a beautiful smile, because I’ve never seen it.\\nWe move to the next twig, and I instruct him with a nod to cut that one\\nand a few more close by. He lays them in my arms as the wind kicks up, and thunder cracks overhead. A shiver runs down my spine.\\nHe reaches around me again, his arms circling me as he lays the last\\ntwig in my arms, and I stay there, waiting for another branch, but…\\nIt doesn’ t come.\\nI close my eyes, feeling a light snowfall hit my cheeks.\\nI want to turn around.\\nAnd I don’ t.\\nKaleb scares me. Making love to him, it felt like… Like I’d never wake\\nup.\\nLike I was suspended. I didn’ t like it.\\nBut I loved it.\\nI was lost but at peace. Driftin g. With Noah and Jake, I can see the\\nfuture. I know what will happen , but with Kaleb, there’ s nothing. I can’t see\\nthe next five minutes, because the feelings evolve. He changes me.\\nI’m afraid I’ll lose my foothold. I don’t want to go back to being who I\\nwas. Scared, waiting, unsure… I don’t want anyone to have so much power\\nover my emotions again.\\nHe just stands there behind me, his warmth making the hair on the back\\nof my neck rise, and I look down at his arms at my side, feeling his head\\ndrop into the back of mine.\\nA lump stretches my throat.\\nBut I lean back into him all the same, a fire coursing through my blood.\\nThis is how he talks to me.\\nHis hot breath hits the back of my hair as he slowly pulls my hat off, my\\nhair fluttering across my face as I tense.\\nThen he brings his arm down hard, knocking the twigs out of my hands.\\nMy chest caves.\\nThe twigs fall to the ground, and I clench my fists, my blood racing. A\\ntornado hits my stomach, and I can’ t move. Shit.\\nHis hands trail down the arms of my black pea coat, his fingers\\ntightening aroun d me, and I only have a moment before he plants his hand\\non my back and shoves me forward.\\nI gasp, stumbling through the snow . The fear makes my stomach sink a\\nlittle, but it warms, too, making the world spin. I straighten, about to whip\\naround, but he nudges me again, not toward the shop and house, but…\\ntoward the barn. I throw a glance  at the closed shop door. Noah and Jake proba bly still\\nwork quietly inside behind the closed door .\\nHe pushes me again. And again until I start walking on my own.\\nSteam billows out of my mouth, my hair falling in my eyes, and I\\nglance behind me to see his gaze locked on me, following my every step.\\nDon’ t be gentle. Don’ t let me for get what I am to you.\\nHe shoves me again, and I whip around this time, ready to push back,\\nbut he char ges into me, pushing me up against the barn.\\nThis is how he is. A breeze one minute, a cyclone the next.\\nHe does exactly what he wants.\\nI barely breathe as he hovers over my mouth. Un-balling my fingers, he\\nyanks my gloves off and works the buttons of my black pea coat. Gripping\\nthe lapels, he yanks me into him, coming for my lips.\\nBut I twist my head away .\\nNo kissing. Not this time.\\nTightening his fingers, he jerks me into him again, bringing his mouth\\ndown, but he only gets within an inch. I hold myself back, shaking my\\nhead.\\nNo.\\nThe heat of his scowl burns my skin.\\nHe grabs me by the jaw, and I clench my teeth as he forces my face up,\\nhis lips crashing down on mine. His mouth sears in his rage, but I steel\\nmyself, keeping my lips closed as I push him away .\\n“Ugh!” I growl.\\nHe stumbles back, and I launch to make my escape, but he grabs me\\nagain, one hand on my jacket and the other in my hair, holding me to him as\\nhe forces his tongue into my mouth. The wet heat sends a shockwave\\nthrough me, and my knees buckle. I want to wrap my arms around him.\\nI want to enjoy this.\\nBut I twist my face away , his lips sinking into my neck. “Kaleb, no,” I\\nchoke out.\\nNo kissing.\\nHe rips his mouth off me, pushes the door open, and shoves me inside,\\nfollowing me and shutting the door behind us. I slip out of my jacket, the\\nwool rubbing against my stitches as I stumble out of his hold. I suck in a\\nbreath at the ache in my arm, but it’ s forgotten almost immediately . I scurry backward, facing him but unable to look at him. If I look at\\nhim, I’ll lose it. I want him too much.\\n“Just no kissing,” I murmur more to myself than him. “Please.”\\nYou scar e me.\\nHe stalk s toward me, and I throw a worried glance to the door behind\\nhim, but it shake s as the wind kicks up and howls outside, and I feel walled\\nin. W e’re out here alone.\\nHe stalk s toward me slowly , and I back up, hitting a wooden beam and\\nwincing as I veer around it. I stare at the ground at his feet, seeing his black\\nand blue flannel dropping to the ground, followed by his black T -shirt.\\nBut I don’t look up as I stop and he closes the distance between us.\\nCircling my waist, he gently lifts me up and carries me to the wall, setting\\nme down.\\nI shake my head. I don’ t like him like this. I don’ t like him gentle.\\nPlanting his arm on the wall above my head, he leans in and touches my\\nface.\\nMy skin tingles where his finger tips graze, and I have to clench my fists\\nto keep from shivering. Softly , I shake my head again.\\n“Don’ t be gentle,” I whisper .\\nClosing his hand around the back of my neck, he jerks me into him, and\\nI almost  smile in relief. Until his lips touch my forehead. He presses his\\nmouth to my skin, warmth spreading down my temples and over my cheeks\\nas his thumb caresses my jaw. My mouth falls open, watering for the taste\\nof him.\\nKaleb. Tears fill my eyes. Please.\\nThe heat of his body surrounds me and anyone else would be freezing in\\nhere, but I can’t even tell. His lips fall to my temple as he breathes against\\nmy skin, and my belly warms,  wanting to wrap my arms around him so\\nbadly .\\nHis nose trails down my cheek,  and then he takes my chin, lifting it to\\nforce my eyes up. But I keep them down, breathing hard.\\nJust bend me over. We’ll both get off, and then I can get out of here.\\nWhat is he doing?\\nHe takes my hand and plants it on his bare chest, but I clench my jaw,\\nimmediately going for his belt instead. I unfasten his jeans and slip my hand\\ninside, grabbing hold of his cock and rubbing to get him hard. He\\nimmediately grabs my wrist, though, and pulls me of f him. He plants my hand back on his chest.\\nHeat seeps through my fingers, making the rest of my body break out in\\nchills, hungry for the same warmth.\\nHe tilts my chin up again, nudging me harder when I don’t raise my\\neyes, and when he dips in, takin g my lips, I plant both hands on his chest,\\ntrying to keep him away .\\n“No!” I twist my face to the side, and his hand slams against the wall\\nnext to my head in anger .\\nI flinch.  He takes my hand again, placing it on his face this time,\\nbegging me to touch him—to look at him, to see him—as his lips move\\nacross my cheekbones and beg for my mouth. His hot breath desperately\\nsearches for mine.\\n“Kaleb, no.”\\nFinally , he shoves away from me, cold air suddenly rushing between us,\\nand I hear his heavy breathing, because I’ve made him mad again.\\nI finally look up.\\nHis glare rips through me, and every muscle on him is tight. He doesn’ t\\nunderstand.\\nI look at his father . I look at his brother . I touch them.\\nAnd last night, I didn’ t hold back in his bed, but today , I know I can’t go\\nthere again, and he doesn’ t get it, because he’s like a fucking child.\\nEveryone has to accept that he doesn’ t have to explain himself. Now he\\nknows what it feels like.\\nGrabbing me by the collar , he hauls me over to him, rips my shirt open,\\nand sends the buttons flying as he tears it from my body . I bring my arms up\\nto cover myself in my bra, my stomach clenching as I watch him fist Noah’ s\\nshirt in his two hands and rip it down the middle, the fabric crying out as he\\nmakes sure I can never wear it again.\\nCatching me by the back of the neck, he pushes me over onto the hood\\nof the car under a gray cover , and I don’t even have time to get up before he\\nyanks my jeans down, pulling of f my boots and socks with them.\\nI growl, pushing myself up, but Noah’ s ruined shirt hits me in my face,\\nand I only hesitate a moment before I slap him across the cheek. He smiles,\\nthe challenge and fury in his eyes as he shoves me back down, yanks me to\\nhim at the edge of the hood, and plants a hand between my legs, fisting his\\nfingers and showing me what’ s his. I gasp, but he moves the hand to my mouth, shutting me up as he yanks my bra down with his other hand and\\ncovers my nipple with his mouth.\\nAnd for a second, we’re right back and finishing what we started that\\nfirst night we met. On a car, him taking what he wants, and me not\\nprotesting fast enough, because I don’t want him to stop. I clutch Noah’ s\\nshirt, trying to cover myself, but he shoves it off my other breast, anger\\nwritten all over his face now as he paws my cunt, rubbing it and digging his\\nfingers in through my panties. Then, pushing my arms over my head, he\\ndevours the flesh of my nipples , and my heart pumps hot as my eyes roll\\ninto the back of my head. Fuck.\\nDon’ t stop. Just like this. Don’ t kiss my lips or look at me or fucking\\nhold me. Just like this.\\nHe rises up, takes hold of the backs of my knees, and jerks me down\\ninto position, pushing my legs open as he digs his cock out.\\nI clutch his brother ’s shirt to my body , covering my breasts, and only\\nhave a moment before he grips my hips and pushes inside of me.\\nI clench my fists around the shirt and squeeze my eyes shut as he starts\\npumping between my legs, my back grinding against the car as he thrusts\\nhard and fast until he’ s finally all the way inside.\\nA groan escapes me. Oh, God . I blink my eyes open to see him leaning\\nover me and looking down as one hand grips my thigh. He pulls out, glaring\\ndown at me as he slides back in, his thrusts getting faster . He falls into a\\nrhythm, strain tightening his face as he gazes at me, and he grabs Noah’ s\\nshirt, trying to pull it of f me.\\nBut I hold it tightly . Just fuck me.\\nHe stares down at me, some thing he knows his brother wants—\\nsomething that belongs to his brother and father , even just a little—and\\nknows that out there, I’m not his to keep.\\nIn here, though? He can sneak a piece. This is what he can have. The\\nstupid little piece of trash he hates, but can punish with a hard fuck when he\\nwants to remind her what she’ s good for . This is what we are.\\nHis dick fills me up deep insid e, and my stomach tightens, because it\\nfeels good, and I don’ t want it to.\\nGasping, I close my eyes, refusing to let myself moan, but I feel the\\nshirt ripped out of my hands. I pop my eyes open, growling as I pull myself\\nup. Asshole… But he doesn’ t give me time to fight him. He wraps his arms around me\\nand covers my mouth with his, holding me tight.\\nI stop breathing.\\nHis thrusts cease all of a sudd en, and his smell surrounds me as his\\nfingers slide up through the back of my hair and hold my head to him, the\\nworld spinning behind my lids at the warmth around us.\\nKaleb.\\nBreathing hard over my lips, he nibbles on me, dragging out my skin\\nthrough his teeth slow and soft all of a sudden, and I open my mouth as if\\non autopilot, letting him have what he wants. The thought of stopping him\\nanymore hurts.\\nPicking me up, he carries me to the door, lifts up the cover , and opens\\nthe car , the heavy metal creaking. Dipping his head, he lays me down across\\nthe front seat of the old vehicle, the cracked leather pinching my back.\\nAnd he comes down on me, slipping back inside me.\\n“Don’ t slow down,” I beg in a small voice. “Please?”\\nSweat seeps out of the pores above my upper lip as he runs the tip of his\\ntongue across his mouth. I’m dying to kiss him.\\nInstead, I grip his hips and urge him faster . “Please?” I whisper in his\\near. “Don’ t be soft. Don’ t make it hard for me to leave.”\\nSoft with Jake is fine. Soft with Noah is fine.\\nI like it soft.\\nBut soft with Kaleb… It hurts. T ears fill my eyes.\\nHe sinks into my mouth slow and deep, and a tornado rips through my\\nbody , swirling all the way down to between my legs. I cry into his kiss.\\n“Tiernan!” I hear someone call. “Kaleb? Anyone in here?”\\nI open my eyes and draw in a breath. Noah.\\nKaleb clamps his hand over my mouth and starts pumping as he sucks\\nand tugs my nipple into a tight point.\\n“Hello?” Noah shouts again, his tone aggravated that he can’t find us.\\nThe tarp is over the car, though,  and even though the door is open halfway ,\\nthe car cover is still drawn over the windows, so no one can see.\\nKaleb fills me, his groan vibrating across my chest as he licks and\\nsucks, and the sound of his voice makes chills spread down my spine. I\\nsuck in air between his fingers, pushing against him and trying to twist out\\nof his hold, but his other hand squeezes my breast, plumping it up to his\\nmouth, so he can devour me. I arch my back into it, moaning behind his hand.\\nFuuuuuuck.\\nHis slow  thrusts tease me as he kisses and bites, making my insides start\\nto whirl like a cyclone, and I fist my hands, wanting to take him, wrap my\\narms around him, and show him the same attention.\\nI want to touch him. God, I want to touch him.\\nMy orgasm starts to build, and I open my mouth to cry out—to get\\nNoah’ s attention , so he’ll end this or join us or something. Anything to stop\\nhis brother and what’ s happening, but…\\nI hold my breath, about to fucking come, and…\\nI don’ t call out.\\nI open my eyes, pull Kaleb’ s hand off my mouth, and wrap my arms\\naround him, kissing him so deep he fucking stills, his body jerking in\\nsurprise.\\nKaleb.\\nKaleb fucking V an der Ber g.\\nI keep my eyes open and move over his lips, watching the creas es in his\\nforehead deepen  as I lick his tongue and moan into his mouth. Tears hang at\\nthe corner of my eyes, but I clench my thighs around him and tense against\\nhis thrusts.\\nI don’ t want to come yet.\\nSinking into his mouth, I thread my fingers through his hair and over\\nthe top of his head, feeling him melt in my arms. I glide my hands up his\\nchest, around his neck, and down his back before sliding them around his\\nwaist, hugging him to me.\\nThe door to the barn finally slams, Noah probably leaving, but I don’t\\ncare anymore. This isn’t real. It’s not really happening. Kaleb will go back\\nto how he always is when we leave this car, and I’ll go back to filling out\\nmy colle ge applications, but in here, I can’t fight him anymore. I want to\\nfeel this. I want to feel what I felt last night in his bed.\\nThe injury on my arm is a million miles away .\\nI kiss him every where. Along his jaw, the scruf f making my skin tingle,\\ndown his neck, behind his ear, and coming back for his lips in between.\\nWhen he doesn’ t rush to move  inside me quite yet and closes his eyes, I\\nhold his head and graze my lips over his eyelids and across his brow ,\\npressing my mouth softly , almo st dizzy from savoring him. His forehead\\nfalls gently into mine, and slow and quiet, we fuck, holding each other . I stare down between us, watchin g him enter me as his mouth hovers an inch\\nfrom mine, and I know he’s watching me. I want to say things to him. Beg\\nhim for more. But even more, I want to hear him say things to me.\\nI look up into his eyes. Relaxing his body on mine, he takes my face,\\nholding us forehead to forehead as I spread my legs wider . Our skin sticks\\nwith the sweat, and I dig my nails into his ass, feeling his jeans just below .\\nMy belly warms, something builds, and I squeeze my eyes shut, ready\\nto cry out as he pumps harder and faster , but he jostles my face in his hand,\\ndemanding my eyes stay on him.\\nI hold his green gaze, the orgasm wracking through my body and\\npleasure sweeping between my legs as I start to come.\\nBut still, I don’ t blink as I hold his eyes.\\nBreath passes between our lips, I tighten my stomach, and then…it\\nexplodes, a wave of tingles spreading down my legs and up into my chest as\\nhe watches my every moment.\\nI open my mouth, feeling it flood through me and not making a sound as\\nI tighten around his cock, heat filling me deep.\\nFinally , a small whimper escapes.\\nI fall onto the seat, my eyes finally closing as he covers my mouth with\\nhis and thrusts a few more times before coming himself. His hot breath is\\nlike a drug, making me weak as his dick throbs and spills. The pulse in my\\nneck beats a mile a minute, and I can’t open my eyes. All I can do is hold\\nhim tight to me as his head lays on my shoulder , his breath hitting my neck\\nas he pants.\\nI want that again. I want that a million more times, a lifetime’ s worth.\\nBut I have a sneaky suspicion I’ll have a hard time finding  it with\\nanyone else.\\nI turn my head, my forehead immediately meeting his lips as his\\npossessive hand squeezes my thigh.\\nKaleb V an der Ber g, you suck.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\n“Tiernan?” I hear Noah call from outside.\\nI look behind me, seeing Kaleb pull his T-shirt on, his jeans zipped up,\\nbut his belt unfastened around his narrow , tight stomach. I bite my lip, my\\nmouth going dry for him again.\\nI roll my eyes at myself. Jesus.\\nButtoning the collar of Kaleb’ s flannel around my neck, I look at Noah’ s\\ntorn shirt laying on top of the car and pull my hat over my head before\\npushing the door open.\\n“Tiernan!”\\n“I’m here,” I say, stepping out into the snow and pulling my coat on as\\nNoah jerks around at my voice.\\n“What the hell?” he scowls and walks over, his cheeks as brigh t red as\\nhis hoodie as the wind blows the ends of his hair that are peeking out of his\\nhat. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere. I was just in there. Where were\\nyou hiding?”\\nI open my mouth, but the door behind me creaks open, Noah’s eyes\\ndarting over my shoulder . Kaleb steps out, snow falling into his hair as he\\nfastens his belt and gives his brother a hard stare.\\nI groan inwardly .\\n“Oh,” Noah mumbles.\\nBlowing out a breath, I turn, looking back at him.\\nHis hesitant eyes dart betwee n Kaleb and me, but he thankfully\\nswallows whate ver he wants to say. Holding up my phone, he tosses it to me. “Phone call. It keeps ringing.”\\nI unlock the screen, seeing several missed calls from Mirai.\\nShit. This can’ t be good.\\nI dial her back and hold the phone to my ear as I head back toward the\\nhouse.\\n“Tiernan,” she answers after the third ring.\\n“Hey , what’ s up?”\\nI climb the stairs and head for the door, my nerves on alert, hearing the\\nalarm in her voice.\\n“I didn’t want to call you,” she says, “but I don’t want you to find out\\nabout it through anyone else.”\\nI swing the door open and kick the snow off my boots before entering\\nthe house. Found out about what?\\n“The Daily Post  published an article, claiming several sources, that your\\nfather…”\\nDread seeps in, and I almost hang up the phone. I hadn’ t realized how\\nnice it’s been, not letting the world in, and I really don’t think I want to\\nknow .\\nBut she wouldn’ t have called unless it was important.\\n“What?” I ask, pulling of f my coat.\\n“That your fathe r was abusive to your mother ,” she tells me. “That he\\nforced her to die with him.”\\n“What?” I blurt out.\\nHow would they come up with that conclusion? And they have sources?\\nBecause I don’t remember anyo ne else being in the house that night to\\nwitness anything.\\nI clench the phone in my hand, but I immediately ease up. Why would\\nanyone speculate something like that? What purpose does it serve?\\n“Tiernan?” Mirai prompts.\\nI swallow . “Yes.”\\nI walk into the kitchen, the scent of the deer stew Jake has simmering\\nfilling the air as Kaleb and Noah enter the house behind me. Jake turns from\\nthe sink and meets my eyes. I look away .\\n“We know it’s not true,” Mirai continues, “but there’ s little we can do\\nabout this, and—”\\nI shake my head, hanging up the phone. Grabbing my laptop on the\\ntable, I spin it around and bring up the Internet. Why am I aggravated? I don’t care what they say about my parents.\\nMaybe it would reveal that they weren’ t perfect, even if the current topic of\\ndiscussion was bullshit.\\nThe guys surrou nd the table, no doubt waiting to know what’ s going on,\\nbut as the page loads, and I type in my parents’ names, the headlines assault\\nme all at once.\\nMy heart pounds against my chest.\\n“What does it say?” Noah asks, peering over my shoulder .\\nI shake my head , anger rising up my throat, and I don’t know how to\\nmake it stop.\\n“Sources claim my father was controlling,” I tell him, skimm ing an\\narticle, “domineering, and my mother feared him. He took her with him\\nbecause he didn’ t trust her loyalty once he was gone.”\\nThis is bullshit. My father lived to see her thrive.\\nI click out of the article, scanning other headlines, Twitter mentions, and\\nlinks to Y ouTube videos. Really? Conspiracy vlogs this fast?\\nA hand grabs my screen and spins the laptop around, away from me.\\n“Don’ t look at it.” Jake slams the top shut. “You knew all the shit they\\nwere spewing, which is why you’ve stayed of f the Internet.”\\nI dig my nails into the table.\\n“Well, is it possible?” I hear Noah interject.\\nHis father shoots him a look.\\n“I mean … It’s not like it matte rs anyway , right?” Noah rushes to add.\\n“They were jerks.”\\nI take a deep breath, trying not to hear him.\\nBut he’ s right. Does it matter? Why is this pissing me of f?\\n“This isn’ t your problem,” Jake tells me in a stern voice.\\nI raise my eyes,  meeting his calm stare. Patient, but… ready if I need\\nhim.\\nI stand up straight and pick my cell back up, scrolling my contacts.\\nI dial.\\n“Bartlett, Snyder , and Abraham, how may I direct your call?”\\n“This is T iernan de Haas,” I say . “I need to speak to Mr . Eesuola.”\\nThere’ s a short pause, and then, “Y es, Ms. De Haas. Please hold.”\\nKaleb hangs back, leaning against a wooden beam between the kitchen\\nand living room , his eyes lowered, while his father and brother stare at me\\nfrom by the table. “Tiernan,” Mr . Eesuola answers. “How are you?”\\nI spin around, facing away from the guys for privacy . “Have you seen\\nthe article in the Daily ?” I ask quietly .\\n“Yes, just this morning.” His voice is solemn. “I’ve already sent a Cease\\nand Desist.”\\nI shake my head. “No.”\\nHe’s quiet for a moment. “Y ou want a retraction printed instead?”\\nI sigh and start pacing the kitchen. “The damage is done,” I tell him.\\n“Readers will believe it no matter what now. I don’t want it to happen\\nagain, though.”\\n“You want to make an example out of them?”\\n“Yes.”\\nWe’re both quiet, and hopeful ly he knows what I’m asking without\\nsaying it. I’m sure it must seem  petty , and I may change my mind, but for\\nall they know , I loved and adored my parents. It’s shitty to print a story you\\ncan’t prove when you know their orphan is watching.\\n“We’ll talk soon,” he says, understanding me.\\n“Goodbye.”\\nI hang up and walk to the sink, drawing a glass of water .\\nJake comes to my side. “Y ou could just make a statement.”\\nI laugh under my breath, turning off the faucet. “Their daughter\\ndefending them?  That’ s believable,” I mumble. “If this goes to court, they’ll\\nbe forced to account for their sources.”\\n“And you’re betting they don’ t have any .”\\n“I know  they don’t have any.” I hold the glass to my lips. “Mirai and I\\nlived in that house. No one controlled my mother . Next to him was exactly\\nwhere she wanted to be.”\\nI take a drink and spin around, heading out of the kitchen and toward\\nthe stairs. I need a shower .\\n“Why do you care?” I hear Noah call after me. “They were awful to\\nyou.”\\nI stop on the third step, trying to push myself to just keep walking,\\nbecause I don’t know how to answer that. It takes a moment for me to turn\\naround and meet his gaze.\\nThe truth is, I don’t know . My heart hasn’ t softened toward them, but\\nsomething has changed since I’ve been here. A line is drawn that wasn’ t\\nthere before. There’ s a limit to what I’ll tolerate now . I shrug, searching for my words, but I don’ t know how else to explain it.\\n“They’re my parents,” I tell him.\\nHis eyes narrow as they all stare at me.\\nBut that’ s all I say .\\nI turn and conti nue up the stairs, almost wanting to smile a little. My\\nmom and dad may or may not deserve my loyalty , but standing up feels\\nkind of good.\\n \\n \\nI twist the wire, binding the twigs to the hanger I stole out of Jake’ s closet. I\\nonly have plastic ones, so it was impossible to contort mine into a circle.\\nUsing the cutter s, I snip off the excess wire and smooth the evergreens\\naround the wreath, smiling at how they fan out but in a way that’s a little\\nchaotic and wild. Growing up, my house was professionally decorated for\\nthe holidays, lots of white, and I’m excited for the more natural Christmas-y\\nfeel. And smell.\\nI check the other bindings on the wreath and crawl on my hands and\\nknees on the living room floor , the dogs passed out in front of the fire as I\\ninspect the garland I made for the mantel with the branches Kaleb and I cut\\na few days ago. My fingers, the tips gold from the paint I used on the\\nbookshelf tonight, peel back the foliage to see if more wire needs to be\\nadded.\\nBut awareness pricks, and I dart my eyes up to see Jake watchin g me as\\nhe sits on the couch. His eyes hold mine for a moment and then he blinks\\nand looks away , going back to watching the movie. I move my gaze to\\nKaleb in the chair , and while his eyes are on the movie, he’s aware of\\neverything in the room except the television. His jaw is flexed, and my\\ncheeks warm.\\nNoah checks the doors to make sure they’re locked and makes his way\\nover.\\nI pop up of f the floor . “Help me?”\\nHe takes one end of the garland, and I take the other , the ache in my arm\\ngrowing stronger because the aspirin is wearing off. We lift the decoration\\nand lay it over the mantel, the whole thing covering the ten-foot length.\\nNoah backs away , letting me fluf f and adjust it, and I bend over , swiping the wreath off the floor . Holding it by the hook, I hand it to Noah and gesture to\\nthe door .\\nHe hangs it, and I stand back, admiring all my handiwork. If only I had\\nsome red ribbon to add. Christm as is in a few weeks, and for the first time\\never, I’m into it.\\nBut when I look at Jake, his eyebrows are raised like he’s expecting\\nsomething more to happen for my hard work all night. Like for the twigs to\\nstart glowing or something.\\nI retreat a little,  chewing the corner of my mouth. “If you don’t like\\nit…”\\nIt’s just a little holiday spirit. It’s not like I sewed ruffles onto his\\ndrapes.\\nBut he rises from his seat and brings me in, kissing my forehead. “It’s\\nbeautiful, T iernan. I love it.”\\nI smile. “Good.” I nod once. “Y ou don’ t want me getting bored.”\\nHe laughs, but Noah grabs me, pulling me down onto his lap on the\\ncouch. “If you need things to do…”\\nHe tries to tickle me, but I bolt out of his lap.\\nJake swats Noah on the head as he heads to the kitchen.\\n“What?” he blurts out. “That’ s not what I meant.”\\nYeah, right. He’s trying not to laugh, but his smile is devilish. I can’t\\nhelp but want to smile, too. I look away , so he can’ t see.\\nWhen I do, though, Kaleb still sits in the chair , two deep creases\\nbetween his eyebrows as he stares at the television but doesn’ t watch.\\nA chill runs up my legs, bare in my silk sleep shorts, and I pull down\\nmy matching sweater , covering the patch of stomach against the cold.\\n“Here,” Noah says. I turn, and he rises from the couch, taking my hand.\\n“Come on.”\\nJake disappears into the shop, closing the door behind him as Noah and\\nI walk into the dark kitchen. He backs me up to the sink and pulls out a\\nchair , sitting down as he reaches under my sweater .\\n“Gimme your arm,” he tells me.\\nI slip my arm out, and he pulls over the first-aid kit we left sitting out on\\nthe counter , and begins unwrapp ing the bandage as I hold the sweater over\\nmy bare breast.\\nI watch him clean my wound, his worried eyes darting to me as I hiss.\\nThe swelling has gone down, but any pressure still feels like a hot poker in my skin.\\nHis touch is gentle, and we fall quiet, me chewing nervously on the\\ninside of my lip. He’ s only quiet when he has things to say .\\n“I’m glad you’re standing up for your parents,” he says in a quiet voice.\\n“Even if they might not deserve it.”\\nI watch him, his unusually sincere tone all the more poignant because it\\nalmost never happens.\\n“I know I’d do the same for my dad,” he explains. “But he would\\ndeserve it.”\\nI’m glad he realizes that.\\nHe tosse s the wipe down and laughs bitterly . “I’m such a little shit. He’s\\nbeen all alone these years. Doing everything alone. Fighting for this family\\nalone.” He shakes his head, more to himself. “We haven’ t really  ever taken\\ncare of each other . Until now .”\\nI remember Jake’ s surprise the other morning at Noah helping out\\nwithout an argument. They’ve  always taken care of each other . Food,\\nshelter , work… I guess he mean s something else. Like how I’m happy and\\nnot thinking about my past. When you’re cared for , you care for others.\\nNoah’ s breathin g turns shallow , and he still won’ t look at me. “What\\nhappens when you leave?” he asks.\\nBut it’s more like he’s thinking out loud. Will they still be invested in\\neach other as a family?\\nAnd then it occurs to me… What happens to me when I leave? This has\\nbecome a home.\\nThey’ve become my home.\\nHe wraps a clean bandage around my arm and stands up, hovering over\\nme.\\nBut he still won’ t fucking look at me, and my eyes start to sting.  I’m not\\nleaving for months. I don’ t want to think about this now .\\nI turn his chin toward me, and he immediately comes in, dropping his\\nforehead to mine.\\n“What if I never let you leave?” he murmurs, his breath tickling my lips.\\nMy chin trembles.\\n“What if…” His arms circle my waist, and he pulls me in tight. “What if\\na lot changed before the summer?”\\nI listen.\\n“What if…” He grabs my bottom lip betwee n his teeth, making me suck in a breath\\nbefore he releases it.\\n“What if we pumped you until you were pregnant?” he whispers.\\n“To keep me here?” I challenge.\\nKnocking me up on purpose?\\nBut he shakes his head. “T o keep you with me.”\\nI narrow my eyes.\\nI open my mouth to speak, but I don’t know what to say. Noah is who I\\nshould be with. If anyone. He’s young, kind, attentive… He talks to me. I\\ncan grow with him.\\nHe’s good.\\nSo why don’ t I tell him that?\\nI take his face in my hands, not sure what I want to say, but before I\\nhave a chance to speak, a dark form appears behind him.\\nI look over his shoulder , seeing Kaleb. I drop my hands from his\\nbrother .\\nNoah turns, and we both see Kaleb’ s gaze on fire as he looks between\\nus. He reaches over, I almost wince, bracing myself for him to grab me or\\nhit Noah, but he simply takes my hand and holds my eyes as he calmly\\npulls me over to him.\\nI go, heat instantly traveling up my arm from where his fingers hold me.\\nHe rubs a tendril of my hair between his fingers as he looks into my\\neyes.\\nI open my mouth to speak, but I don’t know what I want to say. He’s\\nyoung, not kind, and not attentive. He doesn’ t talk to me, and I can’t grow\\nwith him.\\nKaleb’ s not good.\\nBut he’ s the one I want. All to myself. Right now .\\nIn the shower , dark and just us, with his arms around me.\\nStupid girl.\\nHis dark eyes dart to his brother , and he jerks his chin, orderin g Noah\\naway .\\nI hear Noah shift on his feet. “Y ou okay with this?” he asks me.\\nWithout taking my eyes of f Kaleb, I nod.\\nI’m sorry , Noah. Some lessons can only be learned the hard way .\\nNoah lets out a sigh and walks into the shop to join his father as Kaleb\\nthreads my finge rs through his, leading me up the stairs. I’m sore, I’m tired, and I feel guilty , like I should be confused about a lot right now, but I’m\\nnot. All that matters is the next five minutes. The next hour. However long\\nI’m with him.\\nInstead of leading me to his room, he pushes the door open to my room\\nand pulls me inside, swinging me past him. I stumble as he releases my\\nhand, stopping myself.\\nWhat the hell?\\nI spin around and look at him standing there. He looks to my bed, his\\neyes suddenly hard, and jerks his chin, ordering me.\\nWhat?\\nIt takes a minute to figure out what he wants.\\n“Sleep?” I ask.\\nHe wants me to go to bed?\\n“It’s barely nine o’clock,” I ar gue.\\nHe points his finger at me and then the bed, ordering me again, this time\\nwith a scowl on his face.\\nThen he twists around and leaves the room, slamming the door shut\\nbehind him. What the fuck?\\nAnd then I hear it. Metal against metal. A bolt sliding. My eyes widen.\\nI run to the door , twisting the handle. “Kaleb?”\\nThe door won’ t open, and I pound with one palm and jiggle the handle\\nwith another hand. “What is this?” I shout. “Are you serious?”\\nI knew that was too good to be true. His calm downstairs was bullshit.\\nHe was pissed.\\nI yank and pull on the door, beating it with the hand of my healthy arm.\\n“This isn’ t funny!”\\nHe bolted my door? There wasn ’t a bolt on it this morning. Whe n did he\\nput it on? Is he kidding? Oh, my God.\\n“Jake!” I shout. “Noah!”\\nBut they can’ t hear me, because they’re in the shop.\\nI hear his footfalls down the stairs, but instead of tears, anger boils my\\nblood. I’m going to fucking kill him. Jealous, immature, batshit son of a\\nbitch. I’m going to kill him!\\nI kick and pound the door. “What if I have to go to the bathroom?” I\\nbellow .\\nUgh!  \\n \\n \\nHe circles the bed, not taking his eyes off her dark form under  the covers.\\nShe exhausted herself. She bellowed for a fucking hour in here when he\\nlocked her door , and now she’ s passed out.\\nStreams of moonlight glow across her floor , the silence in the house\\nmaking the snowfall against the glass doors almost like a metronome. Tap,\\ntap…tap. T ap, tap…tap.\\nHe climbs on the bed, hovering  over her on his hands and knee s as she\\nsleeps.\\nThankfully , his father and brother never knew what happened. They\\nwere in the shop , far away from  her little tantrum, but even if they weren’ t,\\nhe was ready if they decided to come to her rescue.\\nHe’s sick of her slutting around. Fucking him today in the barn, letting\\nhis father touch her and kiss her tonight, and then about to give it up for his\\nbrother when his back is turned.\\nHe’s sick of seeing her smile when she works on her dumb shit in the\\nshop.\\nSick of her excited by the snow or happy when she feeds the horses.\\nSick of seeing her hair fall across her cheek as she reads at the dinner\\ntable or how she twists her lips to the side when she’s concentr ating on an\\nassignment.\\nSick of her cries at night and how pathetic she sounds during her\\nnightmares.\\nHe stares down at her, cocking his head as her breathing turns shallow\\nand she fists her shirt up at her collar . Her face tenses, and she jerks. The\\nnightmare is starting. Leaning in, he brushes her nose with his, closing his eyes and feeling\\nher panting and how her body tenses and flexes as she dreams. Her brow\\ncreases, and her chin trembles, and part of him wants to do what he always\\ndoes. T ake her in his arms, calm her , and put her back to sleep right.\\nBut this isn’t who she is when she’s awake. She’s mean, and he’s done\\nforgetting that.\\nSinking his mouth to hers, he kisses her, her whimper disap pearing\\ndown his throat as her body tenses and then eases. He almost laughs. He\\ncould be anyone right now. He’ll drop her panties and slip inside her, and\\nshe won’ t even open her eyes to tell which one it is, becaus e it doesn’ t\\nreally matter .\\nHe trails kisses along her cheek, her eyes still closed, not awake yet. He\\nhovers his lips over her skin, moving his mouth but unable to voice the\\nwords. Pretty little cunt.\\nHe grinds on her once. That’ s what she is. Cunt.\\nClimbing off her, he watches her face as he gently pulls her shorts\\ndown. He drops them on the floor and comes back to hove r over her,\\nwatching her face as he slides his hand inside her fucking panties.\\nHis fingers trail between her legs, enticing her to open for him, but he\\nhas to pause a moment to fist his hand, because she’s so soft and smooth.\\nHe loves touching it. Nudging his way in, he finds her clit, and just like a\\nfucking whore, her knees fall apart. He smiles, coaxing her little nub in\\ncircles. Does his dad do this to her? Maybe his brother? She moans for\\nthem, doesn’ t she?\\nHe brings his finger up, licking it, and then puts it on her again,\\nlistening to her sweet little breaths and moans as he rubs her out. He stares\\nat her face. She’ s gonna know it’ s him soon enough.\\nShe lets out a beautiful groan as she arches her neck back and starts to\\nmove into it, wanting it. His dad and Noah are asleep, and he has her all to\\nhimself.\\n“Kaleb…” she murmurs, reaching down to grab his hand but not\\nactually moving it of f her. “You’re an asshole.”\\nHe smirks. He is, and she likes to act like she fucking cares. Putting up\\na fight one minute, and begging  for a dicking the next. She won’t stop him,\\nbecause as long as someone is fucking her, she doesn’ t have to remember\\nall the nothing she is.\\n“Slow .” She pants. “Please…” But he doesn’ t slow down. He pulls her hand off his and forces it up her\\nchest, making her lift her shirt for him.\\nShe pulls up her top, baring her nice tits, and he watches them bob back\\nand forth  as she moves into the rubbing. He leans back, sitting on his heels\\nas he keeps one hand on her clit and moves the fingers of his other hand\\ndown farther .\\nHe teases her ass, rubbing the tight hole, and watching her breath catch.\\n“Kaleb?” she says nervously .\\nBut he doesn’ t stop. Rubbing her and not stopping, he presses the tip of\\nhis finger just inside her and holds it there as he fucks with her clit faster .\\nHer little ass tightens around his finger , warm and making his cock swell\\npainfully , but it just pisses him of f more.\\nHe swipes a finger just inside her pussy , wetting his fingers and keeps\\nmasturbating her while his finger in her ass stays still. Eventually , she\\nadjusts and relax es, getting turned on again and comfortable as she moves\\ninto his hands. She likes both holes filled.\\nBecause of course she does.\\nAfter a few moments, he’s able to slide his finger deeper inside, and\\nthey have a rhythm going now , the room filling with moans and pants as she\\nclimbs toward her or gasm.\\nHe almo st falter s. Looking down at her, he almost wants her to have\\nthis, because she’ s so beautiful, and he loves seeing her smile.\\nHe loves watching her excited by the snow and happy feeding the\\nhorses and how loving she is with the animals and how good her arms felt\\nwhen she hugged him to her in the car today in the barn.\\nBut he pulls his hands out of her little red panties, letting her body shake\\nand her whimpers go unanswered.\\n“No, please,” she chokes out a whisper . “I was almost there.”\\nSweat beads his brow , and he feels fucking sick, but he climbs  off the\\nbed, leaving her hanging.\\nSo far , so good.\\nNow for round two.\\n“Kaleb…” she begs.\\nHe ignores her, dropping his jeans to the floor and pulling her off the\\nbed. She stands there, swaying in her fatigue, and he squats down to slide\\nher panties down her legs. She steps out of them, her hands on his\\nshoulders. “Do you like me?” she asks in a small voice.\\nThe question gives him pause.\\n“At all?”\\nAnd if he weren ’t looking at a woman’ s body , he might think  a child\\nwas speaking to him with how innocent and sweet she sounded.\\nShe swallows. “I thought part of me might like that you don’t talk.” She\\nraises her arms as he stands and pulls her T-shirt off over her head. “I can\\nsay things and not have to hear your response. I hate talking, too.”\\nHe doesn’ t look at her as he plucks the condom out of his pocket and\\nrips it open, slipping it on.\\nShe stands there. “All you can do to me is walk away ,” she mumbles but\\nthen sighs. “I hate it when you walk away .”\\nHe pushes her back down on the bed and climbs on top of her, avoiding\\nher eyes.\\n“I hate the way you look at me sometimes,” she whispers, and he can\\nhear the tears. “Like I’m nothing.”\\nHe lifts her knee high, and works himself inside of her . His dick crowns,\\nfeeling her open up and take him in as he slides in and out until he’s buried\\nto the hilt. He settles on top of her, forcing away the pleasure and warmth\\nwashing over his body and shaking her words from his head.\\n“And then other times…” She kisses him, wrapping her arms around his\\nbody and sliding the tip of her tongue into his mouth. He hardens even\\nmore, sucking air in through his teeth.\\n“I don’t know how to talk sometimes, either ,” she tells him. “This is\\nhow we talk. This is the only time I feel like you like me.”\\nThe backs of his eyes burn, and he kisses her deep, tasting the tears on\\nher cheeks. He kisses her everywhere. He does like her. He’s wanted to\\ntouch her from the first moment, and he’s been here, watching, as inch by\\ninch she started to laugh and become a part of them all.\\nHe thrusts, the top of his body molded to her as he encases her head in\\nhis arms and kisses her .\\n“Kaleb…” she pants, her pussy clenching. “Kaleb. God.”\\nHe can feel her about to come. She always comes so good. He rolls his\\nhips faster and faster , wanting to love her. Wanting to let her have it,\\nbecause she was made for him. Neither of them knows how to let people\\nlove them, but they don’t have to talk with each other . This is how they say\\nit. He doesn’ t savor anyone like he wants to savor her. Her scent, her\\nsound, her touch…her taste. The feel of her arms around him feels like he\\nthought nothing ever could.\\nHe wants to love her .\\nHe wants to please her .\\nHe wants to trust her and to see her holding his baby someday .\\nHis thrusts slow as he wonders how they loved her, too. All the words\\nshe whispered in their  beds.\\nShe’s not hard to please.\\nAnd as the images of his father and brother with her tonight flash in his\\nmind, he’ s reminded…\\nWomen he loves for get him.\\nHe stops, and she whimpers, her body shaking as the second orgasm\\ntries to push through her, but loses steam and drifts away , letting her float\\nback to the ground.\\n“No,” she breathes out. “Please… Kaleb, what are you doing?”  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nHe rises up, grabs me, and flips me over. Something circles my wrist, and I\\nknow what it is before I even look.\\nThe belt he’d given me on my birthday had been sitting on my bedside\\ntable, and he takes it, tightening it around my wrist and looping it around\\nthe wrought iron headboard above.\\nOh, shit. He yank s on it, pulling me up, and I have no choice but to\\nclutch the bars with both hands for support as he secures me.\\nHe forces my knees apart.\\n“Kaleb…” I start to protest.\\nI feel my wetness on the inside of my thigh, and every muscle inside me\\nburns. I shake. What is he doing?\\nHe digs his fingers into my hips and jerks me back into him, quickly\\nsliding his cock back inside me. I squeeze my eyes shut, stingi ng from the\\nrawness as he damn near punche s a hole right through me. This doesn’ t feel\\ngood.\\n“Kaleb…”\\nBut I don’ t know what I want to say , my head is spinning.\\nHe fucks me, pounding his hips hard behind me as I hang onto the\\nheadboard and my hair bounces across my back.\\nHe threa ds a hand through my hair, gripping the back of my scalp, and\\nfor a moment, I can’t breathe. All I hear is the sound of skin hitting skin as\\nhe fists his hands and makes my body hurt.\\n“Kaleb, stop.” He pushes my back down more, making my ass jut out as he releases\\nmy hair and reaches around to paw my breasts and dig his teeth into my\\nneck.\\nTears hang at the corner of my eyes, and for a moment, all I can do is\\nhang on as he pumps harder and faster .\\nIt’s too deep, though. It hurts.\\nHe’s taking. Fucking me like I’m nothing.\\n“Kaleb, stop.”\\nHe doesn’ t hear me, though, his hand landing on my ass with a loud\\nwhack and his breath pouring in and out of his lungs. I suck in a cry, the\\nbelt digging into my skin.\\n“Stop!” I scream.\\nI work the belt wider , slipping my wrist out, and then I whip around,\\nhitting him I don’t know how many times. I burst into tears, seeing the rage\\non his face, and scramble off the bed. Naked, I run from the room. He\\ncatches me and yanks me back to him, but I slap him with everything I have\\nand bolt into Noah’s room, locking the door. He pounds on the wood, and I\\nhear Noah move in bed.\\n“What the fuck?”\\nI back away from the door , waiting for Kaleb to break through, but…\\nHe doesn’ t. I try to catch my breath, but my knees start to give.\\n“Tiernan?” Noah says.\\nI crawl in his bed, pushing him back down and spooning him from\\nbehind. I wrap my arms around him like a steel band.\\n“Go back to sleep,” I mutter , trying to quiet my tears.\\n“What did he do?”\\n“Nothing.” I bury my head in his back, the warm skin smelling  like my\\nbodywash that he always steals. “Just let me hold onto you.”\\n“Did he hurt you?” he asks, trying to turn around, but I won’ t let him.\\n“Tell me the truth.”\\nI can’t speak. I just shake my head. I’m the only one who hurts me. I\\nbelieved it was real. Whatever was happening between us for however long.\\nHe hates me. That wasn’ t love.\\nKaleb doesn’ t come back to Noah’ s door, and I think I hear his footfalls\\non the stairs at some point, but after a few minutes, my breathin g calms and\\nmy tears subside. Noah just lies there, letting me hold him.\\nI tighten my arms around him again. I don’t understand what’ s happening. He wants me one minut e and is\\nthrowing me away the next. He’s gentle and horrible. Vulnerable and\\nhateful.\\nHe shares me with Noah and then gets possessive. What does he want?\\n“He was with our mom,” Noah tells me, breaking the silence.\\nI open my eyes, feeling his voice vibrate against his body .\\n“It was a rainy , spring day, and some guy she’d been running with on\\nthe side was with them,” Noah goes on. “They had gone to the store—or so\\nshe told my dad. Instead, they went to a white house off a dirt road\\nsomewhere, and she left Kaleb in the car. Locked it and said she’d be back\\nin a bit.” He pauses and then continues. “She went inside and the brief stop\\nturned into a party . She got high, lost time, and fell asleep in the house.”\\nThis is only the second time Noah has mentioned their mother. He\\nmust’ve been a toddler at the time.\\n“He was alone in the car with no one around for miles to hear him call\\nout or cry when the minutes turned into hours. And hours into days.” I close\\nmy eyes, not wanting to hear the rest. “There was no food in the car and the\\nonly water came from the leak in the roof when it rained.”\\nI try not to see it, but an image of a little boy alone—cold and hungry—\\nflashes in my mind. Kaleb was a child at one time. He was helpless then.\\n“At some point his throat went raw from crying out,” Noah explains,\\n“but when my father finally found him, he wasn’ t crying or calling out. Not\\nanymore. Just sitting in the seat in his own filth staring off and barely even\\nregistering when the door was finally opened.”\\n“How much time?” I ask. “How much time did he lose?”\\nIt takes a moment for him to answer . “Four days.”\\nMy face cracks and silent tears fall.\\n“Something separated in his head,” Noah tells me. “What goes through\\nyour mind when something like that happens, you know? When one day\\nturns into two and two into three? You’re four years old. You can’t get out.\\nYou can’t figure  out what to do to help yourself. You’re starving. You’re\\ncold. You’re alone. You can’t stand up. You don’t know when help is\\ncoming…”\\nI turn it all aroun d in my head for a moment trying to imagine how long\\nthe hours felt to a four-year -old. Minutes filled with fear feel like hours, and\\nhours of fear feel like an eternity . “It must’ve felt like he was buried alive,” Noah adds. “The doctors said\\nhe gave up. A wall just sprung up, and over the years not talking became\\nthe one piece of control he had when he had none during those four days in\\nthat car. His voice was the one thing no one could demand from  him. It was\\nhis way of punishing everyone. A way to make the world share the pain.”\\nNeedles prick my throat. Yeah, I know what that’s like. Denying  myself\\nanything that made me happy for so long because I couldn’ t let it go. It\\ncouldn’ t not matter .\\nKaleb has been punishing the world his whole life, almost like me.\\nUnfortunately , the world moves on, and then it just become s punishing\\nyourself.\\n“Don’ t cry for him,” Noah finally whispers. “Especially not in front of\\nhim.”\\nAfter a while, Noah falls back to sleep, and I’m not sure how long I lie\\nthere, thinking about what he told me.\\nKaleb almost died. Slowly . Painfully . That would be a nightmare for\\nanyone at any age. How much does he remember?\\nHopefully not much.\\nIt changed him, though. He turned inward and couldn’ t trust again.\\nThat’ s why he doesn’ t speak. Not out of spite necessarily . He doesn’ t want\\nto give anyone a piece of himself again. People hurt.\\nHe may not even  know how to talk anymore. It’s not like four-year-olds\\nare enunciating full speeches to begin with. You can’t really lose an ability\\nyou never had.\\nAnd it’s hurt the whole family . His mother must be in prison for other\\nthings to keep her there this long, so she’s all but dead to them. Jake had to\\nraise two boys on his own, miles away from the help that Kaleb needed, and\\nNoah never really knew his brother. He’s never known what Kaleb could’ve\\nbeen. They’ve all been alone, and somewhere in the time I’ve been here,\\nwe’ve all learne d to care about each other , but I also created a whole other\\nwedge. Kaleb couldn’ t learn to live with another woman in the house, and\\nwhen he tried, the lines were fucked up. How did I fit? Was I his cousin?\\nHis friend? His brother ’s?\\nHis?\\nI pull my arms off Noah and swing my legs over the bed, sitting up, the\\nweight of my role in all this sinking in. He acts wrong. He treated me wrong\\ntonight. I’m confused, too. I’m making mistakes, too. But I don’t want to hurt him. All I know for sure is that I can be there.\\nMaybe over time he’ll trust me as a friend.\\nHopefully as someone who cares about him, at least.\\nI stand up, looking at the clock and seeing it’s after four in the morning.\\nI pick up a clean shirt out of Noah’ s laundry basket of clothes he never puts\\naway and slip it on. Leaving the room, I close the door and head for the\\nshower .\\nAs soon as I open the door, though, the steam hits me. The shower is\\nrunning, and I spot Kaleb sitting there on the edge of the tub. I stop, my\\nheart beating fast again.\\nHis elbows rest on his jean-clad knees, and he hangs his head, quiet. He\\ndoesn’ t look up.\\nI almost turn and leave. I need space. He needs space. Right now,\\nanyway .\\nI don’ t, though. I step in and close the door .\\nSlowly , I walk over to him and stand in front of him, waiting. Maybe for\\nhim to make a move or for him to lash out and storm out the door, but I’m\\nnot leaving for months yet. He can’ t get away from me.\\nWhen he doesn’ t make a move to escape, I hold out my hand and lightly\\ngraze his soft, dark hair .\\nHe immediately clutches it in his own and nuzzles his head into it.\\nI let out a breath.\\nKneeling down,  I come in and circle my arms around his waist  and lay\\nmy head on his chest, hugging him. I wish I knew what he wanted. I wish I\\ntrusted him, and I wish he trusted me.\\nFriends is a better way to start. Can we go back?\\nHis arms hang limply at the side, and while he lets me hug him, he\\ndoesn’ t hug me back. I let go, letting him have his space.\\nLooking up at him, he doesn’ t meet my eyes. He pinches my shirt,\\nstaring at it. At Noah’ s T-shirt.\\n“It’s okay ,” I tell him softly . “I didn’ t do anything with Noah.” I glide\\nmy hands down his arms. “I’m not going to…”\\nMy right hand comes to his right hand, and I notice he’s holding\\nsomething in it. I stop, bringing it up and taking the piece of wood from his\\nfist.\\n“What is this?” But it doesn’ t even take a second to realize exactly what\\nit is. The blue-green leg of my chest I painted with gold accents. I turn it\\naround in my hand, my heart pumping so hard that a cool swea t breaks out\\non my forehead.\\n“What happened?” I dart my eyes up to his, breathing hard. “What did\\nyou do?”\\nTears spring to my eyes, and I drop the leg, running to the door. No. I\\nrace from the bathroom, down  the stairs, pain and anger curdling in my\\nstomach as I bolt into the shop. The frigid air hits me as I see the bay door\\nopen, and I leap down the stairs, into the shop, and spin around, frantically\\nsearching for my chest. My first piece. The one he helped me design.\\nAnd all at once, it’s not there, and I see the barrel outside in the snowy\\ndriveway , spitting fire, remnants of the colored wood I painted sticking out\\nof the top.\\nMy hand s shoot to my head, everything going blurry in front of me as\\nsilent sobs wrack through me.\\nNo.\\nI stand at the open door, watching sparks fly into the black night and\\nany traces of my piece quickly deteriorate into the barrel. My hair blows\\nacross my face,  and I cover my eyes with my hands, unable to stand the\\nsight of it.\\nBut in my head, all I see are my stupid, kid drawings in the trash.\\nStupid, stupid… I cry into my hands.\\nThe stairs creak behind me, and I clench my teeth, wanting to kill him. I\\nwant to hurt him. Why would he do that?\\nSpinning around , I head over to the wall in my bare feet and grab a pipe\\nfrom the collection of parts. When I turn around, he’s there within reach. I\\nraise the pipe like a baseball bat, glaring at him, and ready to kill him. I’m\\ndone. I can’ t take anymore.\\nI swing, but instead of smashing his head, I slam the fucking steel into\\nthe bookshelf I finished today . The side splinters, giving way, and I’m gone.\\nLost in my rage, I beat the fucking piece—slamming the bat as hard as I can\\ninto the sides, on the top, and moving to the desk I started a few days ago,\\ntoo.\\n“You can’t hurt me!” I scream. “There’ s nothing you can take from me!\\nI don’t care about anything. I’m nothing!” I growl, destroying everything I\\nmade and beating it as hard as I want to beat him, because this is it. Now he fucking knows there’ s nothing he can do to me. There’ s nothing anyone can\\ndo to me. No one gets that power anymore. No one matters.\\nI cry, covering it with another growl. No one.\\nI’m stronger than you. There’ s nothing you can do to me.\\n“What the hell?” I hear someone shout. “What the fuck is going on?”\\nSomeone grabs me, pulling the pipe out of my hands, and I whip\\naround, seeing Jake. His shirt is open, and his feet are bare, and Noah hangs\\nback by the door , watching in horror .\\nJake looks between his son and me, breathing hard.\\nI clench my fists, a beautiful numbness seeping down over me.\\nKaleb holds my gaze for a moment, the pulse in his neck throbbing, but\\nthen turns and grabs clothes off the dryer , finishing getting dressed. He\\ndoesn’ t even have his boots tied before he slips on his coat and grabs his\\nstocked pack, heading for the door .\\n“Wait, what the fuck is going on?” Jake grabs his son.\\nKaleb jerks out of his hold and continues walking.\\n“You’re not going anywhere in this weather!” he yells at Kaleb.\\nKaleb stops, turns, and looks at me. His eyes falter for a moment,\\nlooking sorry or some shit, and for a moment I think he’s going to come\\nback.\\nHe simp ly holds my eyes, lays his hand flat on his chest, and taps it\\ntwice.\\nI don’ t know what it means, and I don’ t fucking care.\\nWithout sparing another momen t, he turns and leaves, disappearing into\\nthe cold night.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI take a bite of my toast, holding it between my fingers as I prop the book\\nopen at the table. Their eyes burn my cheeks, but I avoid their gazes as I\\ncopy notes from the text into my notebook.\\nI take another bite.\\n“Are you okay?” Jake asks.\\nI flip the noteb ook over, continuing the sentence I’m writing. “I’m\\nfine.”\\nThe wind howls outside, and the snow kicks up and taps at the\\nwindows. The animals have been tended to, but we won’ t be doing much\\nelse outside today . It’s below zero.\\nNot that I’ve been helping much lately anyway , and I don’t really care\\nwhat Jake has to say about it. I dare him to pick a fight.\\n“You’re fine,” Noah repeats. “You’ve said that every day for the past\\nweek. And yet, you’ll barely talk to us.”\\nGuilt pricks at me, and I forget what I’m writing. It takes a moment to\\nremember the word I was jotting down and continue.\\nNoah doesn’ t deserve my silent treatment. Neither does Jake, really .\\nIt just hurts. I don’t know what hurts exactly or why it hurts, but I’m\\nangry , and I can’t pretend I’m not. Jake followed Kaleb that night, and I\\nwent directly to the shower that was still left running, sitting in there for a\\nhalf hour before my shivers and tears subsided.\\nWhen he came back, though, he came back alone, and I haven ’t cried\\nsince. W e haven’ t seen Kaleb. “I’m sorry he did that to your piece,” Jake tells me, holding his cup of\\ncoffee.\\nBut I just shrug. “It doesn’ t matter . It’s not like I was taking it with me\\nin April anyway .”\\n“April?” Noah blurts out, and I hear him shift in his chair . “College\\ndoesn’ t start until August.”\\n“I’ll be finished with my course  work soon,” I tell them, not looking up.\\n“As soon as the roads are clear , I’m going home.”\\nI’m eighteen, I’m financially independent, and I don’t belong here. Why\\nwould I stay?\\nI feel Jake lean in, tense. “ This is your home.”\\nMy eyes burn, and I flex my jaw to keep my emotions from betraying\\nthat I kind of like hearing that.\\n“We love you,” he adds.\\nBut I just snicker . “So what did you think?” I ask, still writing. “I’d bed-\\nhop every night for the rest of my life, as if we weren’ t all completely\\ninsane? I was never going to stay .”\\nWhat did he expect to happen ? I’d marry one of them? Live in the\\nboonies and have all their babies?\\nOr mayb e we’d  just go back to being a family . Uncle, cousins, niece?\\nI’d bring my husband here someday to meet them, the poor guy never\\nknowing I’d screwed everyone in this house?\\nHow did Jake think this was going to end?\\n“We would’ve backed of f,” he says. “Kaleb is in love with you.”\\n“Kaleb…” I breathe out a laugh. “Is an animal. I’d be surprised if he\\nremembered the color of my eyes right now. Like any girl, I only matter as\\nmuch as his next piece of ass. That’ s what I’m good for to him.”\\nI finish writing my sentence.\\n“He wasn’ t right.” Jake watches me as Noah sits quietly across from\\nme. “And he communicates by losing his temper . He was wrong, yes, but he\\nwas hurt. The only woman he ever loved forgot about him. Almost killed\\nhim.” He pauses. “He’ s in love with you, T iernan. He was jealous.”\\nTears spring up, a cry I won’ t let out aching in my throat. I want to\\nshake my head. I want to yell and tell them it doesn’ t matter . He can’t treat\\npeople like that, and it’s his choice how he communicates. No one is\\nstopping him from saying what he needs to say . So, he’s jealous. So, his father  and brother are in the way. He didn’ t\\nhave an issue sharing me the night of the fire. Am I supposed  to read his\\nmind whenever he suddenly changes it? He’s not a human. He’s a bear. His\\nlove feels like shit.\\nI straighten, slamming my book  closed and picking up my stuff as I rise\\nfrom the table. I walk around the kitchen, quickly pushing the thoughts\\nfrom my head as I leave.\\n“Tiernan,” Jake calls after me.\\nI stop, hesitating a moment before I turn my head.\\nJake sits in his chair , looking at me. “When Kaleb stopped talking, I\\ntried to use sign language with him,” he tells me. “I still remember some of\\nit.”\\nAnd then he puts his palm to his chest and taps twice, imita ting the\\ngesture Kaleb made before he left last week.\\n“This…” he says, “means ‘mine’.”\\n \\n \\nSteam drifts out of my mouth, clouding into the air. The peak lies ahead, the\\nview so much the same as the first time I stood on this balcony back in\\nAugust. But so dif ferent, too.\\nThe chill has seeped through my white knit hat, and I hug myself with\\nthe brow n plaid blanket Mirai sent me in the fall wrapped around me and a\\nmug of cocoa in my hands.\\nMy teeth chatter . The wind chill is well below zero.\\nAnd for a moment, I let my guard down and wonder . Where is he?\\nI stare out at the view , the snow -covered trees spread out all the way to\\nthe snow-capped peak, beautiful and desolate. Cold and lonely .\\nThere’ s only two directions he would’ve gone. Deeper into the forest, to\\nthe fishing cabin. Or to town.\\nKaleb hates town.\\nThe frigid air stings my lips. Another minus twelve degrees and\\nfrostbite can happen in as few as fifteen minutes. My fingers soak up the\\nwarmth of the mug, but even now, the blood is running cold, making them\\nhard to stretch.\\nI try to stay longer , to feel what he might be feeling out there,  but it’s\\ntoo cold. I love the snow , but when it gets to this temperature it’s not fun anymore. I turn around, the snow on my balcony crunching under my hard-\\nsoled slippers.\\nSliding the glass  door open, I kick off my shoes just inside and step into\\nmy bedroom, closing and lockin g the door behind me. The fire crackles to\\nmy right.\\nI walk over to my bed and pick up my pillow , smelling the case. It\\nsmells like Snuggle. I washed the sheets after Kaleb left, but his smell was\\nstill here somehow . Now , it’s gone.\\nTossing the pillow down, I drop my blanket to the bed and pull off my\\nhat, standing there for about three seconds before I just let my feet carry\\nme. Drifting out of my room, I loiter in the hall, shuffling my feet for a\\nmoment before I disappear up Kaleb’ s stairs. It’s only about three in the\\nafternoon, and despite the tense talk at the breakfast table this morning,\\nJake and Noah are happily working in the shop, pulling together in Kaleb’ s\\nabsence. How are they not more worried? I’m pissed at him, but it’s winter .\\nHe could die out there. What if he didn’ t even make it to the cabin?\\nTurning the knob, I swing open his bedroom door, the room dark except\\nfor the light coming from the window , and step inside.\\nI close my eyes, inhaling his scent. The world spins behind my lids, and\\nI feel dizzy . Why can’t Noah’ s smell do this to me? He’d be so happy to\\nhave me in his arms tonight. He’s been good about not being obvious, but I\\nknow he wants to hold me. He wants me to look at him.\\nWalking farther into the room, I step over to the bed and pick up one of\\nKaleb’ s pillows,  his sheets rumpled and his blanket half hangi ng onto the\\nfloor . I press the pillow to my nose, the icy coolness of his pillowcase\\nmaking me shiver before I can breathe him in.\\nI draw it in, not smelling anything at first, but then it’s there. Still there.\\nThe trees and thistles, wood and leather . And something else. Something\\nyou only get when you’re burie d in his neck. Heat swirls low in my belly ,\\nand I sit down on the bed, weak.\\nIt’s cold in here. Dark and dusty. The fireplace is black from years of\\nash, and even though he didn’ t take anything that I would notice, it feels\\nabandoned.\\nWalking over to the far wall, I stand at the picture window and stare into\\nthe woods, the snowy landscape beautiful and peaceful.\\nI’m still angry . And if he walk ed through the door right now and wanted to make\\namends, I’d probably roll over and lap up any scraps he wanted to offer. He\\nwould win.\\nHe’s winning right now. It’s been a week, and I’m right back where I\\nwas when I first came here. Making myself unhappy , because…\\nBecause I’m only worth anything if someone wants to love me.\\nJust like with them.\\nThe tears that have been perpetu ally burning at the backs of my eyes for\\nthe last week dry, and I draw in a long, deep breath, releasing everything\\nand the weight on my shoulders along with it.\\nI’m bigger than this. I want to live.\\nSpinning around, I leave the room and close the door, taking one last\\nlook at his space before I do.\\nThen, I head downstairs and into the shop, turning the music the guys\\nare listening to up as I get started on the armoire.\\nNoah smiles at me, I pull on my goggles, and we all get to work.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nTwisting the handle, I rev the engine, the back tire skidding under me and\\nmaking a half moon in the snow . I sit down, lock my boots on the pedals,\\nand speed off, racing up the salted driveway as the dark clouds hang\\noverhead.\\nI love this weather . It’s in the twenties, and while December and\\nJanuary were painful it didn’ t take long to toughen me up. I barely wear a\\ncoat outside these days.\\nI’m not even sure what day it is, only that it’ s February . I think.\\nI pull to a stop at the shop door and take off my helmet, hanging it on\\nthe handlebar as I climb of f the bike.\\n“I love it!” I tell Jake.\\n“Want one?”\\nI smile, watching him wipe the grease off his hands. “Maybe something\\nstreet legal, instead.”\\nHe shakes his head, and I lean on the washing machine, kicking off my\\nboots. The cuff of my beautiful Aran Islands sweater is unraveling, a wool\\nstring hanging over my hand, but it only feels good, because I know my\\nclothes have now been lived in, worn for hours and days doing things I\\nlove.\\nFive pieces of furniture sit around the shop—two end tables, a\\nheadboard, another chest, and the wardrobe. I would’ve finished more in\\nthe past couple of months, but I completed all my coursework already , got my college applications done, and tried a ton of new recipes, using our\\nperishable food while it was still good.\\nIt’ll still be at least eight weeks before I can taste a fresh, crisp apple,\\nthough. I can’ t wait to get to town.\\nBut then some days, I hope the snow never melts.\\nThere’ s dirt under my nails, and I never need make-up because I’m\\noutside every day , earning my rosy cheeks.\\nJake tosses the rag down and looks at me. “It doesn’ t have to be street\\nlegal,” he tells me. “If you keep it here.”\\nI meet his eyes, but then bend over to scoop the clothes out of the dryer .\\n“For when you visit, I mean.”\\nI nod, but I don’t look at him again. I know what he wants. He’d love\\nfor me to stay, but he’ll settle for an assurance that this is home base when\\nI’m on school breaks.\\nHe’s assuming I’ve calmed down, and I’ll stay through the summer .\\nI can’t, though. I might be the reason Kaleb hasn’ t come home. Maybe\\nhe will once I’m gone.\\nWithout responding, I put the clean clothes on top of the dryer , toss in\\nthe wet ones, and jog up the stairs into the house.\\nBlowing into my hands, I rub them together as the heat of the fireplace\\nwarms the area. Guilt pricks at me as I refresh the dogs’ food and water . I\\ndon’t want to ignore Jake’ s request, but I have two months yet. At least.\\nI don’ t have to dread leaving them yet.\\nOf course, it seems like yesterday that I said the same thing in\\nDecember .\\nHeading through  the living room , I climb the stairs, but the front door\\nopens behind me, and I look over my shoulder , seeing Noah step in. He\\nkicks his boots of the snow and whips of f his hat and work gloves.\\nHe looks up, and my eyes meet his eyes.\\nHe smiles like a devil, and my heart skips a beat.\\nNo.\\nI gasp and bolt up the stairs, hearing his footfalls behind me, charging\\nmy ass. I squea l, grabbing his arm as he passes me, both of us stumbling\\nand laughing as we race for the shower .\\n“I’m first!” I shout.\\nWe both scramble for the bathroom, slamming into the door and falling\\ninside. I tumble to the floor , and he follows, grabbing my legs to stop me from standing up. I kick him, screaming and laughing, and reach up for the\\nsink, pulling myself up.\\nI dart for the shower , but he stands up, locking me in and pressing his\\nbody into mine.\\nMy stomach shakes, feeling his heat and breath surround me.\\nAnd in a moment, everything quiets. The laughing stops.\\nHe hovers over me, his chest rising and falling against mine, and I can\\nsmell the fire on his clothes from the burning he did outside.\\nHis dick rubs me through my clothes, and I shift.\\n“You can go first,” I say. “You need to take care of some thing, it\\nseems.”\\nI try to step to the side, but he stops me. “You need to take care of\\nsomething, you mean.”\\nHe stares down at me, and I can feel the heat rolling off him. All that’s\\nstanding in his way is me.\\n“Do you love him?” he asks. “Because if you don’t, then come in the\\nshower with me, because my body is screaming.”\\nI remain still.\\nMaybe I should. It would feel good.\\nKaleb is staying away for a reason, after all. He’s either trying to outlast\\nmy depa rture, so he doesn’ t have to see me, or he knows he can’t expect to\\ncome back at this point and find me untouched in his long absence,\\nespecially in a house with men I’ve already been with.\\nEveryone wants this to happen.\\nAs he leans in, though, I plant my hands on his chest. “No.”\\nI shake my head, keeping him back.\\n“You love him?” he asks.\\n“I don’ t know .” I frown.\\nI don’ t love you, though.  Not like that.\\nNoah needs his brother a lot more than he needs me. I don’t want to be\\nin the middle.\\n“Don’ t use all the hot water ,” I say , and I leave the room.\\nHeading downst airs, I go for the kitchen to check the stew in the crock\\npot, but a faint yell hits my ears, and I look up, seeing Jake on the phone.\\n“If you don’t put her on the phone, I swear I will have her airlifted out\\nof there!” “Jesus, fuck,” Jake growls, pulling the receiver away from his ear and\\nglaring at me. “T iernan…”\\nHe tosses me the phone, holding his cof fee in his other hand.\\n“I don’t want that woman calling here anymore,” he tells me. “Answer\\nyour phone.”\\nHuh?\\nI hold the phone to my ear .\\n“That woman?” Mirai repeats in disdain. “What does that mean? He’s a\\nbarbarian.”\\n“Hey .”\\n“Hey ,” she snips, suddenly realizing I’m on the line. “Happy holidays,\\nTiernan.”\\nI wince. “Y eah, I know . I’m sorry .”\\nWe’ve been sticking to email and texting for the last ten weeks, and\\neven though she’s called, I haven’ t answered. I didn’ t feel like conversation.\\nWith texting, we can state our business quickly without trying to make up\\nshit to talk about.\\n“Tiernan…”\\n“I’m really sorry ,” I tell her again. “I’ve just been…”\\n“Living your life,” she finishes for me. “I get it. You’re not getting rid\\nof me, though, okay?”\\n“I know.” I lean on the island as Jake hangs back, looking in the fridge\\nand trying to look like he’ s not eavesdropping. “Y ou got my present, right?”\\nShe lets out a laugh. “Yes. Very generous. You saying I need a\\nvacation?”\\n“Or an affair,” I tease. “A ragin g, hot, and mad affair with a man. Or\\nmen.”\\nJake turns his head, looking at me over his shoulder .\\nI bought Mirai a trip to Fiji. Her and a plus one.\\n“What do you know?” Mirai laughs again.\\n“Is she hot?” Jake whispers to me.\\nI glance at him, the aggravation on his face suddenly gone. I roll my\\neyes.\\n“So, are you happy?” she asks.\\nNoah turns on music upstairs, and Jake lifts the lid of my stew, dipping\\nhis spoon in for a sample. Tonight, they’re making me watch Starship\\nTroopers  for the first time. I’m warm, well-fed, and loved. There’ s nothing I need that’ s missing.\\nBut still, I drop my eyes. “Almost,” I murmur .\\nWe talk for a bit, and she lets me know that Mr. Eeusola conta cted her\\nabout the gossip rag and they got the newspaper to print a retrac tion, as well\\nas fire the repor ter. Hopefully , it sets an example that I’m not interested in\\ntolerating rumors about my parents for the rest of my life.\\nAfter we hang up, I check on the dinner , adding the potatoes in I peeled\\nthis morning.\\nWashing my hands, I stare out the window , seeing how the snow around\\nthe drive way has started to slush . We still have more storms coming, but the\\npast few days have been a nice reprieve from the bitter temperatures.\\nI lean in, peering up at what I can see of the sky. The clouds look heavy .\\nMore snow on the way .\\nI feel Jake behind me, and I look back, seeing him gazing out the\\nwindow , as well.\\nHe looks down, something intimate in how his eyes drop to my mouth.\\nHe takes a step back. “Sorry .”\\n“It’s okay .”\\nWe have n’t been  together since before the fire. I’ve been sleeping alone\\nsince Kaleb left.\\nI dry my hands as he takes a sip of cof fee.\\n“Another storm’ s coming,” he says.\\nI nod, staring past the trees. It’ s starting to get dark.\\n“Has he ever been gone this long?”\\nI hate that I asked, but I’ve wanted to ask every day. It’s been over two\\nmonths. Has he ever missed Christmas? Does he ever stay in this long?\\n“No,” Jake finally answers.\\n“Aren’ t you worried?”\\nHe pauses, his voice quiet as he explains. “I’m not taking you that deep\\ninto the woods in the winter . And we can’t leave you here alone. If he isn’t\\nback by the time you leave, then I’ll go in.”\\nBy the time I leave…\\nFor the first time, it hits me. I may not see Kaleb again.\\n“Tiernan, I want you to take Noah with you when you leave here,” Jake\\nsays.\\nI turn. “What about you?” He’s relenting? Noah’ s desperate to leave. When did he finally come to\\nterms with it?\\nAnd Kaleb’ s gone. If I take Noah, then Jake will be alone.\\nHe simply looks down at me, a resigned half-smile playing on his lips.\\n“I’ll be okay .”\\nI blink away the burn in my eyes. I don’t want Jake to be alone here. If\\nKaleb has survi ved in there this long, he may never return. Picturing Jake\\nalone this time next winter… It aches.\\nI reach up on my tiptoes and wrap my arms around him, feeling his\\nhands reach around me, too.\\nHolding his head, I bury my nose in his cheek, a sob lodged  in my\\nthroat. I open my mouth, nearly going for his. I want to kiss him. I want to\\ntake care of him and give him love, because he’s going to die up here, never\\nsharing his life with anyone.\\nI can make him feel good.\\nHis mouth hovers over mine, and I know he wants it. His fingers dig\\ninto my waist.\\nBut the hair at the back of his scalp is too short. It scratches my hand,\\nnot like Kaleb’ s soft black hair .\\nSlowly , I drop my arms, and he pulls me in, hugging me instead.\\nI wrap my arms around him and close my eyes. I can’t leave him alone.\\nEither , Noah stays, or Jake comes, too, or…\\nI don’ t know .\\nI wander back upstairs alone. What’ s going to happen when the roads\\nopen in eight or so weeks? It’ s not much time. Is this how it ends?\\nStanding at the bottom of Kaleb’ s stairs, I look up at his door. I haven’ t\\nopened it since December . No one has, but nothing has changed, I’m sure.\\nStill cold, but probably a little dustier .\\nI climb the stairs.\\nThe faint light out of the window  casts the room in twilight, and I close\\nthe door behind  me, rubbing my arms against the chill. I walk  over to the\\nfireplace and take a couple logs, laying them inside with some kindling.\\nSwiping a match on the mantel, I light the fire and watch as the flames\\ngrow , warmth and light immediately drifting toward me.\\nThe soft glow flickers across the floor , and I take the match, lighting a\\nfew candles he has set on the mantel and one by his bed.\\nKaleb has candles. Heh. I flip on his old iPod dock, an Amber Run song starting to play as I\\nwalk over to the bed and fan out the blanket and sheet, fresheni ng them up.\\nI fall on top, lying down and staring up at the ceiling as I reach around and\\ncaress my cheek.\\nLike he did when he carried me to his bed.\\nMy heart aches.\\nI close my eyes, tears hanging at the corners. Mine. He’s mine. He\\nshould’ve stayed and fought with me.\\nI lie for a while, staring off and letting my mind wander . The room\\ndarkens as the sun sets, but it warms with the fire, and I don’t know where\\nthe time goes, but finally , I hear a knock on the door .\\n“Tiernan?”\\nI blink, wanting to be left alone. But I sit up. “Y es?”\\n“Dinnertime,” Noah says.\\nHe must’ve searched everywhere before finally realizing where I was.\\n“I’ll be down later ,” I tell him. “I’m tired.”\\nI don’t even look at the clock, but it has to be around six. I don’t feel\\nlike a movie tonight.\\nThere’ s silence on the other side of the door, but after a few moments,\\nthe stairs creak with Noah’ s footsteps.\\nI roll over and bury my face in the pillow .\\nBut I feel something hard and move my hand, gripping the object inside\\nthe case. What is that? I lift my head up and reach inside, pulling it out.\\nI hold a worn, brown hardba ck book and peer at it in the dim\\ncandlelight, flipping it over to read the spine.\\nDon Quixote V ol. II\\nI smile and sit up, shaking my head. He’ s such a surprise. He reads.\\nOf course, his shelves to my right are filled with books, but I kind of\\nthought they might’ve been stored here, and he was too lazy to move them\\nover the years.\\nSitting cross-leg ged, I pull the book into my lap and fan throug h it, the\\nsmell of the old paper , tinged yellow , wafting over me.\\nI open it to the middle, hearing the spine crack.\\nI almost laugh. I thought so .\\nAlthough aged, it’ s not broken-in. He’ s not reading this.\\nSo why is it in his bed? I let the pages fan closed but spot something right as the book goes to\\nclose. I catch it, opening up the cover again and bringing it closer to read\\nthe black writing.\\n \\nIt’s funny how women come to me so easily now, it reads.  They used to\\nsay that I was stupid in school.\\nStupid.\\nStoooopid.\\nStoopid.\\n \\nI narrow my eyes, making out the scratchy handwriting inside the cover .\\n \\nI am stoopid.\\nBut they sur e like to fuck me.\\n \\nA lump lodges in my throat, and my breathing turns shallow .\\nKaleb?\\nHurriedly , I flip through the pages again, checking inside the back\\ncover , but I don’t see any more writing, and I sit there, excited and shocked.\\nAre these Kaleb’ s words?\\nI jerk my head to the bookshe lf, the mountain of texts strew n about,\\nstacked in the shelves, and overflowing. Jumping out of bed, I rush over,\\npicking up a book. Any book.\\nDrawings of a cabin line the flyleaf at the beginning of the book, and I\\nflip to the back, my heart about stopping when I see more handwriting.\\n \\nDeep. I always want to be there. I hate it here. I want to be there. In the\\nvalley , where the river creeps and the wind rushes me. Surrounded by the\\ncreaks. It smells like deep. T astes like deep. I want the world to be smaller .\\nI hate it her e.\\n \\nI barely notice the tears spilling as I pull books from the shelves,\\nfrantically searching for more.\\nHe doesn’ t read the books. He’ s writing in them.\\nAfter sifting through a few empty ones, I find another with scribbles and\\nmarkings carved  into the paper so deep, it’s like he sliced the page with his\\npen.  \\nFuck , he writes.\\n \\nFUCK.\\n \\nAnd more scribb les, violent and dark as if the page is hemorrhag ing ink.\\nWhen did he write this? What had happened?\\nI open another text.\\n \\nSaw her smile today . I like having a girl ar ound.\\n \\nI read it five more times, searching for more on the pages, but there’ s\\nnothing else. No dates. Is he talking about me or…?\\n \\nYou only yell at me now, he writes in another . I know it’s my fault. I\\nknow I can’t speak. I can. I just can’t. I… I’m not here. This is all I have and\\nall I am. I can’ t. I’m not her e.\\n \\nI notice the bookmark he’d placed there. I flip it over and see a picture\\nof Jake with the boys. Noah can’t be more than five as he sits on a dirt bike,\\nhis dad behind him.\\nKaleb is around  six, his hair much longer as he stands off to the side,\\nstaring of f. He’ s always somewhere else.\\nI dig more books from the shelf, finding one with scratched-out marks\\nover most of the writing, but I can still read it.\\n \\nMr. Robson asked us what we wanted to be today . I had so many\\nanswers.\\n \\nWas Robson a teacher?\\n \\nI want to be outside , he goes on. I want to be in a tree. I want to be wet.\\nI want to be on the forest floor as the rain hits the leaves above. I like that\\nsound.\\nI want to be warm. I want to hold something. I want to talk to my dad. I\\nwant to be tir ed, so I can sleep mor e, and I want to walk.\\nI want to be in love. I want to be safe. I want to be over .\\nI want things in my head to be gone.\\n \\nBut then all of that is scribbled over , leaving one simple line.\\n \\nI want to be everything she sees.\\n \\nI stare at the handwriting. She? I shake my head, more to myself.\\nThere’ s no dates on any of these? Nothing is filed in a discer nible order .\\nSome things are printed in block letters, others in cursive. Some of the\\ncursive is third grade, some comes from a man. There’re years of musings\\non these  flyleaf s, and he hid them here, because he knew no one would\\nopen these old, tattered books.\\nHe writes everything he couldn’ t say.\\n \\nYou knew me a long time ago. You know you don’t know me now. Trying\\nto teach me signing, like I can’t talk. I stay silent because I want you to\\nleave me alone. Signing won’ t help.\\nI grab another book, separating the ones I already read in a pile.\\n \\nSaw some wolves take down a doe today . I should’ve shot the fawn. It\\nwon’ t last the winter without her. It’s out there fucking starving now. I\\nshould’ve fucking…\\nI’ll find it tomorr ow and shoot it.\\n \\nNoah doesn’t say anything, does he? When I always need the windows\\ndown in the car, even in the winter, because it’s so hard to breathe. I like\\nNoah. He lets me be. He lets everyone be and doesn’ t need to understand\\neverything. He doesn’ t have questions all the time. He can just let it be.\\n \\nI dry my eyes and wet my dry lips, snatching up another book. Noah\\nknows why he needs the windows down in the car .\\n \\nSaw her smile again today . She turned her face towar d the sky and\\nclosed her eyes. I kind of get it. Like I don’t need to fucking talk all the time,\\nshe doesn’t need to open her eyes to see the peak. She likes it here. I can tell\\nby her smile when she doesn’ t know anyone sees her. Needles prick my throat and my vision blurs again. She always exha les when she does that,\\nlike she’ s been holding her br eath.\\nThat’ s me. I know he’ s talking about me.\\n \\nFound candy in the trash and kale on my pizza. She’ s fucking weir d.\\n \\nI laugh through my tears.\\n \\nGod, she feels good. She looks like she’d be pudding in your fist. Soft.\\nToo soft. It was so good, though. Those seconds on the car that she let me\\nbury my face in her body . Her skin is like water . I want her smell in my bed.\\nAnd in my hair . And never far away fr om me.\\n \\nI envisio n him up here all those nights alone. Scribbling away in the\\nbooks. All those nights wasted. Maybe he wrote this before he saw me\\ncome out of his father ’s room. We both could’ve done things so much\\ndifferently .\\n \\nSlut. Why can’t I fucking leave? It’s time to go in. I’ve been here too\\nlong. That fucking slut. That stupid slut.\\n \\nGo in. Deeper into the mountains, he means. It’s where he runs when\\neverything hurts.\\n \\nTiernan… another book reads. But that’ s it. Just my name.\\nI flip to the back and take a breath, seeing more.\\n \\nThey’r e such deep sleepers, they don’t hear you at night. Just me. When\\nI touched your face, you quieted. When I tried to leave, the nightmar e\\nstarted again. So I stayed. I come in every night. You tuck your cold feet\\nbetween my legs, and I hug you to me, resting my hand on your back and\\nfeeling your body calm as it nestles into me. Do I make you feel safe? I like\\ntaking car e of you.\\n \\nI stare at the text. How did I not know that? How long was he coming\\nin? Even when we fought?\\n  I know you’r e scared of me, and I know it’s my fault. Cici trying to slap\\nme in the cave that day, because I didn’ t want her, and instead,  falling into\\nmy shoulder and bloodying her own damn nose ended up being  the least of\\nyour worries. I did horrible things to you all on my own. I hate that I never\\ndid anything to get you to love me. Y ou’ll never love me.\\n \\nI clench my teeth, struggling to see past the tears.\\n \\nYou make me shake. My hands shook at the tree with you today, and I\\ndon’t understand  what it is or why it’s happening. I just feel it. I never want\\nyou to walk too far away fr om me.\\n \\nThe tree. In December when we cut branches for the decorations. He\\nwrote this after we made love in the barn.\\n \\nYou scare me. I scare you. Don’ t let me hurt you anymor e. Why can’t I\\nstop wanting to hurt you? Just fuck them, okay? Keep fucking them, so I\\nwon’ t want you so damn much. I’m a mess, because wanting you feels good,\\nand I don’t know what to do when things feel good. Everything is a mess,\\nand I’ll make a mess of all of it, but…\\nI’m going to miss you.\\nI’ll miss you.\\n \\nI exhale what little air I’m holding.\\nHe’s killing me.\\nAll this time I pushed it away , trying to survive and act like I could win,\\nbut he’s right. It’s a mess, and we’re a mess, but I always knew that if he\\nwalked through the door and said anything to me—or communicated in any\\nway—I’d melt. All I’ve ever wanted was one glimpse into his head.\\nI stand back, taking in the shelves and the dozens of books still waiting\\nfor me. Not once, so far , has he mentioned his mother .\\nHe doesn’ t care.\\nThe pages are filled with what he loves.\\nI’m not leaving Jake here alone. I’m not leaving without Kaleb and me\\nhaving it out. I’m not taking Noah without them saying goodbye.\\nI want him home. I don’t know how much time I spend looking through more books and\\nrereading parts I loved, but the house is dark and silent when I finally leave\\nhis room  and come down the stairs. I missed the movie, but it’s okay . I’m\\nglad Jake is asleep.\\nI slip into Noah ’s room, hearing the faint sound of his music, and walk\\nover to his bed, jostling him awake.\\n“What?” he groans and turns over , wiping the sleep from his eyes.\\nI lean down. “Let’ s go get Kaleb.”  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\n“It’s eighteen degrees,” I tell Noah, exhaling inside my jacket to soak up the\\nwarmth. I look up at the overcast sky. “Those clouds are less than six-\\nthousand feet. W e’ve gotta move.”\\nSnow swirls in the wind around  us, but it’s only the beginning. A storm\\nis coming.\\nI slip on my goggles and tighten the hood of my coat, following him\\nthrough the snow in my boots and waterproof pants as he heads north.\\nAfter I got him out of bed last night, we loaded up the snowm obiles,\\npacked on our gear, and headed  out while the weather was still good. Once\\nthe sun rose, the chill was beara ble, but now the clouds are rolling in, and I\\nfucking misjudged that the storm wouldn’ t turn.\\nIt did.\\nJake will be pissed. I left him a note on the table, letting him know we\\nwere heading deeper into the woods to the fishing cabin. Of course, there’ s\\nno guara ntee Kaleb is there, but it’s the likeliest choice. I don’t care if Jake\\nfollows us. I only refrained from waking him, because I knew he’d stop us.\\nNoah pulls to a stop ahead of me, the flakes growing thicker as they\\nwhip across our faces.\\nHe looks at the map, removing his goggles and wiping his eyes.\\n“I thought you knew the way ,” I tell him, stopping at his side.\\n“Just gimme a break.” He turns the map around and searches the terrain.\\n“I’ve been up here five times in my life, all before the age of twelve. Kaleb\\nand Dad like it up here, not me.” “Great.” I shake my head.\\nTaking the laminated documen t from him, I scan Jake’ s sketch. He\\nmapped the area years ago, marking his own landmarks—ponds, streams,\\ncaves. Things that were recognizable to him.\\nTo me, it’s Chinese, though. The mountains and trees on the map all\\nlook the same as I scan the area around us.\\nI shove it back at Noah, letting out a hard sigh. Don’ t we have GPS\\nthingies now? Something that taps into a satellite? I curl my toes in my\\nboots, my legs shaking a little. I take a step, sinking knee deep into the\\nsnow as I do a three-sixty and look around me.\\nThe tree boughs  sparkle in white, bunches of pine cones hanging from\\nthe branches, and I spot a narrow ravine to the left. I pull out my water\\nbottle from my pack, both of us loaded down with everything we could\\ncarry when we finally had to abandon the snow mobiles due to the terrain.\\nWe’ve been on foot since eight this morning, our rifles strapped to our bags.\\nI look up at the clouds again, unable to even locate the sun. It must be\\naround two in the afternoon, though.\\n“Kaleb said it was ‘in the valley’,” I tell Noah. “‘Where the river creeps\\nand the wind rushes.’”\\n“Kaleb said?”\\nI glance at him, mumbling, “I found a journal. Of sorts.”\\nHe stares at me for a moment, but then fixes his gaze out on the horizon\\nof the lonely white forest.\\n“Valley with a river ...” he murmurs to himself.\\nStudying the map again, he chews his chapped lip, looking confused. “I\\nhave no idea,” he blurts out. “I don’t see that here. Did he say anything\\nelse?”\\n“Surrounded by the creaks?” I tell him, unsure if I read that correctly in\\nthe book. “Not a creek. Creaks. Like the sound.”\\nNoah straightens, staring off as the wheels turn in his head. I move in\\nfront of him, giving my back to the wind.\\nFuck, it’ s cold.\\n“What?” I ask him.\\nHe blinks. “It was like a flue,” he says. “Like a chimney flue. The glen\\nwas small, enclosed by rock walls and trees. When the wind would blow in,\\nit would rush through and out, sounding like a chimney flue.” He lifts his chin, his shoulders relaxing as he exhales. Thunder cracks\\noverhead, and I glance to the sky , hugging myself.\\n“And the snow from the peak would melt and come down in a waterfall\\nthat we couldn’ t see beyond the walls of the glen, but the flow forked into\\ntwo streams,” he finally remembers. “One feeds where we fish. The\\nother…” He meets my eyes. “I know where he is.”\\nI close my eyes. Thank God.\\nWithout another  word, he darts to the left, near the ravine, and pulls off\\nhis hood, leaving him in his black ski cap to see better . He takes my hand as\\nwe stumble and slide down the hill.\\nThe sky bellows again, and wind sweeps through the narrow valley ,\\nflakes stinging my face as they hit. I pull my warmer up over my mouth and\\nnose, seeing lightning strike across the sky .\\nI whip around, worried.\\n“Shit,” Noah exclaims, pulling me faster . “Come on.”\\nWe trail as fast as we can through the deep snow , but my muscles are\\nburning, and my fingers are frozen through my gloves. I fist my hands.\\nThe wind rushes , trapped between two mountains, and all I can hear is\\nmy pulse in my ears.\\n“How much farther?” I shout.\\n“I have no idea!” Noah tells me, pointing to the line of snow between\\nthe trees. “W e just follow this!”\\nA shot of lightning strikes suddenly , hitting a spruce on the incline\\nabove us, and I scream.\\nNoah falls, startled, and I lean over to grab him. “Noah!”\\nI grit my teeth, using every muscle I have to lift him out of the snow .\\nHe pulls his hood back up and grabs hold of me, hugging me to keep me\\nwarm.\\n“It’s only going to get worse,” he says. “We need to pitch a tent and\\nwait this out!”\\n“We’re not pitching a tent with metal rods on a mountain in a lightning\\nstorm!” I tell him, backing away . “Let’ s go!”\\nI lead the way, taking us throu gh the valley and climbing over snow-\\ncovered boulders toward Kaleb. I hum to myself, squeezing my fists to keep\\nthe blood flowing, knowing each step brings us closer to the cabin.\\nI’m worried he’ s not okay . It’s been so long. I’m also worrie d I’ll want to kill him for disappearing like this. How\\ndare he just live up here like nothing matters. I don’t care if we fight. I’m\\nactually looking forward to it. Just as long as he’s there and just as long as\\nhe’s breathing.\\nPebbles hit my hood, the tap against the fabric sporadic but hard. I tip\\nmy face up, bullets of ice belting my cheeks.\\nI dip my head back down, crouching under the onslaught. “Sleet!”\\n“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me,” Noah growls.\\nHe takes my hand, and we run, seeing a cave ahead. Racing toward the\\nentrance, we dive inside, out of the wind, snow , and ice, and I pull my hood\\noff and my warmer down, wiping of f my face with my gloved hand.\\n“You okay?” Noah asks.\\n“Yeah.”\\nMy face burns, and I’m afraid to look at it. I can just hear Jake now.\\nWhy would you do something so stupid?\\nAnd he’d be right. This was dumb.\\nI’d probably still do it again, though.\\nNoah shivers, shaking out his coat and blowing into his hands.\\n“I thought you grew up here?” I tease.\\n“Shut up.”\\nI smile. Tenderfoot.\\nI go to take off my pack, but then I look up, feeling snow still falling on\\nmy face. Light enters above us, and I look to my right, seeing more light\\nahead.\\nThis isn’ t a cave.\\nIt’s a tunnel.\\nWalking toward  the exit, I clutch the straps of my pack and step into the\\nopen, pulling my hood up again.  Snow falls, the wind sweeps through, and I\\nfeel the tiny taps of sleet hitting my jacket, but it’s calmer than on the other\\nside of the wall.\\nMuch calmer .\\nTrees loom over us, clusters of firs and spruces dressed with snow, and I\\nhear the water . Rock walls surround the glen, which is about half the size of\\na footba ll field, the only entranc e I see is the one we just came through. The\\narea is shielded by rocks and trees, but the weather still swoops in from\\nabove, open to the sky and bringing in the cold, snow , and wind, albeit not\\nas fierce. Looking up, I see the cabin on the hill.\\n“Oh, thank you, God!” Noah cries out behind me.\\nMy heart leaps, and I close my eyes, smiling.\\n“Kaleb!” Noah shouts.\\nHe runs, and I race after him, up the small hill and toward the cabin. I\\nlet my pack fall of f me, and I drag it up onto the small porch.\\nNoah drops his, too, our rifles strapped to the packs and both of us\\nkicking our snow-caked boots against the little house. “At least, I’m not\\ngoing to die now,” he grumbles, “because if I’d gotten you killed, they\\nwould’ve killed me.”\\nI laugh, leaving my pack and throwing open the door .\\n“Kaleb!” I call, entering the house.\\nBut even before I can get my bearings, my smile falls.\\nHe’s not here.\\nLiquid heat pumps through my body , and I don’t think I breathe. Jake\\nwas right when he said this place wasn’ t for me. It’s one room with a stove,\\na fireplace, and two beds. There are three windows, no other doors, and no\\nbathroom. It’ s a place to cook and sleep when they fish, nothing more.\\nThe wet air permeates, and I look around, grasping onto anything to\\ngive me hope this wasn’ t all for nothing.\\n“He’ s not here,” Noah says, squeezing past me.\\n“Has he been, though?” I ask. “He could be out hunting.”\\nHe walks to the stove, picking up a pot. From here, I can see the\\nremnants of something inside it.\\n“It’s frozen.” He shakes his head. “He was here, I think. The dishes\\naren’ t dusty , so they’ve been washed recently , but it’s been a couple days, at\\nleast.”\\nWalking over to the rumpled bed, I lift the sheet to my nose. The cold\\nand the cabin are the only scents I find, though.\\n“Where else would he go?” I drop the sheet. “Could he be heading back\\nto the house and we missed him?”\\n“He wouldn’ t have left these guns.” Noah pulls out a rifle, and I see\\nothers tucked in the corner .\\nThe guns.\\nYou left yourself unpr otected.\\nNoah’ s words come back to me, and I walk over, seeing three rifles\\nstanding in the corner , one I know Kaleb uses a lot. If he’s out, he would have it. Why doesn’ t he have it?\\nI back away , a sob lodged in my throat. Where the fuck is he?\\nThe dishes, the dirty pot, the guns…he was here. Where did he go and\\nwhen?\\nI breathe  hard, unable to contro l where my fears are going as tears fill\\nmy eyes.\\nNoah approaches, taking my shoulders. “Let’ s take it slow. We don’t\\nknow anything.”\\nI twist away from him, though, pulling one of the rifles out of the corner\\nand checking to make sure it’s loaded. Thunder cracks outside  again, and\\nsnow pummels the windows.\\n“Let’ s go,” I tell him.\\n“We’re not going out in this again.”\\n“Noah!” I whip around to face him. “He wouldn’ t be out there willingly\\nin this. He could be injured or—”\\n“If you go out there, you’re dead!” he growls. “And then I’m dead,\\nbecause I’ll have to follow you, and I know almost less than you do about\\nsurviving up here! I’m putting my foot down. W e wait out the storm.”\\nHe’s right. I know he’s right, but is he serious? I can’t sit here all night.\\nHow can he?\\nI look at the door .\\nWhat if a wolf or a bear got to him? What if he’ s cold and dying?\\nA tear spills over as my feet itch to run. What if he died out there\\nmonths ago, his bones r otting in the snow?\\nI debate making a run for it.\\n“Don’ t even think about it,” Noah bites out as he takes off his coat and\\nstarts the fire in the stove. “I will tie you up, T iernan. I swear to God.”\\nAnd I close my eyes before planting myself at the window for the rest\\nof the night, watching for Kaleb.\\n \\n \\nI yawn, my eyelids heavy and my arms like ten-ton weights. I put my hand\\non the anchor over my waist and realize it’s Noah’ s arm as he spoons me in\\none of the beds. I blink the sleep away , nestled into his body and still\\ndressed in my jeans, sweater , and wool socks.\\n“Hey ,” he says in a sleepy voice. I turn my head. “Is it over? The storm?”\\n“Yeah.” He tightens his hold on me. “Listen.”\\nI train my ears, hearing the steady drops hit the windows and tin roof,\\nclanking against  the windchime dangling off the front porch. It’s a different\\nsound than snow .\\nOh, my God. “It’ s raining?”\\n“Right?” he jokes.\\nBut the wind is gone, as well as the rocks of sleet that hit the small\\nhouse last night.\\nRain. Not snow , which means it’ s not as cold.\\n“Will rain make the snow slippery , though?” I ask.\\nNoah rises and lets out a loud yawn. “It probably means we didn’ t get\\nmuch snow , actually .”\\nHe leaves the bed and pulls on his shirt, and I sit up, tucking my hair\\nbehind my ears. How can he only be in his jeans? The fire helped, but it\\nwas still cold in here last night.\\nHe slips on his jacket and tosses me some granola we packed  before\\ngrabbing a rod. “Stay in bed, eat, and hydrate,” he says. “I’ll go catch some\\nbreakfast, and then we’ll head out.”\\nI stiffen. “W e’re not going home.”\\nHe opens the door, looking so tired. “I mean, head out to find him,\\nbabe.”\\nI relax, relieved. “Hey ,” I call.\\nHe turns and looks at me.\\n“Be careful.”\\nHis eyes soften, and he gives me that smile.\\nThen he closes the door and leaves. The river runs behind the house, so\\nhe probably won’ t go far, and I take the opportunity while he’s gone to go\\noutside and relieve myself, melt some snow to wash up, and eat and hydrate\\nlike I’m told.\\nPutting on an extra pair of socks, I change my sweater and tie my hair\\nup into a ponytail. I actually slept well because Noah kept me warm, but I\\nthink he insisted we share a bed because he was afraid I’d bolt in the middle\\nof the night to find Kaleb.\\nI’m glad I didn’ t try. Coming up here with just Noah was stupid enough.\\nGoing out alone would be suicide. After washing the dishes we used and checking my boots by the fire to\\nmake sure they’re dry , I grab my pack to do a supply check.\\nBut I see something move outside the window and stop.\\nI look up, squinting.\\nDropping the pack, I walk over to the door and carefully twist the\\nhandle, opening it gently .\\nCalming my breathing, I peer out into the rain, opening the door wider\\nand wider , cringing when the hinges creak, but I don’ t want to scare it of f.\\nI step out onto the porch, water spilling over the roof to the ground as\\nthe buck stands like a statue in front of me.\\nMy chest swells. Wow.\\nHis antlers stretch like a giant U over his head, splintering off into\\nsmaller branches as his large, brown eyes stare at me like he’s waiting for\\nsomething.\\nThe rain falls around us, his hooves buried in the snow , and I falter ,\\nfeeling my gun behind me in the house. Jake would tell me to shoot him.\\nWe’re here without much food, and who knows if we’ll get snowed in\\ntonight or tomorrow . I shouldn’ t balk at meat where I can get it.\\nHe’d be right.\\nI throw my arms out, though, and whisper -yell. “Go!”\\nHe darts  off, past me, and I follow him with my eyes to make sure he\\ngets away before Noah can see him.\\nAnd then I spot something and freeze, locking eyes on Kaleb in the\\nbrush as he points his rifle at the white-tail.\\nMy mouth falls open. Kaleb.\\nI faintly  hear the deer’s trot disappear as Kaleb’ s rifle stops at me, no\\nlonger following  the animal as he peers through the scope. He lifts his head,\\nsteam billowing into the air from his mouth.\\nI blink to make sure I’m actually seeing him and not some hallucination.\\nHe wears a dark gray hoodie, black ski cap, and his jaw is covered with\\nscruf f. He stares  at me, his arms falling to his sides, and his chest rising and\\nfalling in shallow breaths.\\nAbsently , I step down the wet steps in my socks as he walks  slowly\\ntoward me.\\n“Hi,” I say .\\nHe stands there, and I’m not sure what to do. W e found him. He’ s fine.\\nI think. I scan his body , making sure he hasn’ t lost weight or isn’ t injured.\\nWhere the hell was he all night?\\nI don’t even care, though. His beautiful eyes. His cheekbones. His\\nmouth and tanned neck that I know will be warm. Of course, he would have\\na tan in the winter .\\nI swallo w. “Noah’ s downstream, looking for breakfast,” I say in a low\\nvoice. “W e were worried about you.”\\nHe inches forwa rd, and I drop my eyes to his ankles, seeing his jeans\\nare soaked from the knees down.\\n“You missed Christmas,” I say .\\nTears lodge in my throat. I’m desperate for him to talk. To want me like\\nhe did that night of the fire with Noah and that afternoon in the barn.\\nMost of all, I just want to see him.\\nI chew my lip. “Can you come home?” I whisper .\\nJust come home.\\nLet’s start over and be friends. I’ll be nice, you’ll be nice, and you don’t\\nhave to talk. We’ll laugh and work and go for walks and you can show me\\nhow to use the bow and arrow , and…\\nHe rushes me, wrapping his arms around me, and only a whimper\\nescapes before his mouth is on mine.\\nThe world spins , and euphoria washes over me. He kisses me deep, his\\ntongue dipping in and making my body scream from my head down to my\\ntoes. I circle his neck and kiss him back, too fucking high to go slow,\\nbecause I’m starving.\\n“I love you, Kaleb,” I cry quietly . “I love you.”\\nHe drops his rifle and carries me into the house, kicking the door closed\\nbehind us. We bite and kiss, coming back for more and more, and I pull off\\nhis swea tshirt and he kicks off his boots. I throw off my sweater and peel\\noff my socks as he unfastens my jeans, our lips never leaving each other .\\nLet’s not be friends. Let’s fight and laugh and make babies some day and\\ngo insane, because I’m fucking in love with you.\\nHe pulls away and lifts up my arm, inspecting the small piece of raised\\nskin barely noticeable. “It’ s okay ,” I assure him. “Y ou stitched me up well.”\\nI was injured the last time he saw me. Just a faint scar remains now .\\nHe breathes hard, but his shoulders relax in relief. Taking my head in\\nhis hands, he kisses me hard, no tongue, just fierce and strong and\\npossessive. He missed me. We fall on the bed, his hair longer and hanging in his eyes as we get rid\\nof our clothes and he settles between my thighs, already hot and hard. I hold\\nhis head in the crook of my neck, running my hands all over his body .\\nHe slips inside me, and I wrap my arms tightly around him, afraid to let\\nhim go too far from me again. Forehead to forehead, he looks down into my\\neyes.\\n“There’ s been no one since you,” I whisper .\\nMaybe he doesn’ t need to hear it, but I want him to know .\\nHe kisses my mouth, my nose, and my cheeks, thrusting his hips\\nbetween my legs, and I can’ t let him go.\\nI don’t want to ever let him go. Not in April when the snow stops. Not\\nin August when school starts. Not ever .\\nHe gazes down at me, and I look up into his eyes, smiling and vaguely\\nhearing raps on the door .\\n“Hey!” Noah hollers. “Open up!”\\nI hug Kaleb as he keeps going, my eyes closing as he fills me and hits\\ndeep. The bed rocks against the wall, and I moan as Kaleb fists my hair .\\n“So you found Kaleb, I guess?” Noah barks. “Come on, it’s cold out\\nhere!”\\nBut I’m coming , and I can’t stop. I grab Kaleb and kiss him hard, barely\\nregistering the sound of whatever Noah throws against the door .  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI touch his face, tracing the ridge of his nose, down to the dip above his lip,\\nand then over his mouth. His eyes are closed, but I know he’s not sleeping\\nas he holds me to him in the bed.\\nNoah sleeps across the room, and I’m not sure what time it is, but I\\nknow it’ s early morning. Rain still taps the roof and windows.\\nI love you.\\nHe didn’ t say it back, though.\\nHe may never say it back.\\nOh, the irony . Six months ago, I ran from a life of people who wouldn’ t\\ntalk to me and ended up falling for a guy who may never say a word to me.\\nI stare up at him, threading my fingers through his black hair and picturing\\nthe little boy who lost all hope that day in that car when he was four .\\nI drop my eyes to the thin tattoo  down the back of his neck, betw een his\\near and his spine.\\nCredence. I’m close enoug h to read it now. It means ‘belief as to the\\ntruth of something’.\\nI’m not sure I understand.\\nAnd then, maybe I do.\\nIf he doesn’ t tell me he loves me, then how do I know he does? What if\\nI’m what he wants until the snow melts and he can have Cici or any one of\\nthe girls in town?\\nWhat if I don’t truly understand what’ s happening here, and I’m more\\nhis than he is mine? The truth is…it doesn’ t matter . I’m going to love him for as long as I\\ncan, because that’ s what makes me happy .\\n“Can I stay with you here?” I ask him.\\nHe opens his eyes, peering down at me. Then, he shakes his head,\\npinching his eyebrows together like that would be the worst idea ever .\\nMy pride is bruised until I choose to just believe he doesn’ t want me\\nliving in this hovel with no indoor plumbing.\\n“You haven’ t been lonely?” I press.\\nHe just trails his fingers down my arm, and after a moment , finally\\nnods.\\nI lie my head on his chest, hearing Noah snore. “I remember the feeling\\nof Mirai’ s arms around me when I was sick,” I tell Kaleb. “I was little, but I\\nremember how good it felt to be held.” I tighten my arms around him. “And\\nto hold something. It’s probably the most peaceful moment in my life that I\\nremember . Until I stepped into the glen, that is.”\\nIt didn’ t register at the time, because I was so caught up in where I was\\nand seeing the cabin, but it’s beautiful here. Hidden, serene, pure… His\\njournal entries make sense now that I see it. I could do with a few more\\nmodern conveni ences and maybe a few more people to talk to, but I can see\\nwhy he loves it.\\nHe doesn’ t have to face anything here. And I get it. Sometimes, we all\\nneed to hide.\\n“When the world feels small,  nothing can hurt you.” I caress his\\nstomach, feeling his abs flex under my hand. “You want to stay there,\\nbecause you’re protected. For a while anyway .” I stare off, thinking about\\nhim and me and how I hid inside myself all those years because I didn’ t\\nwant to be rejected anymore or hurt. “But then you realize you’re the only\\none who fits there in that small world, and being alone feels worse than not\\nfeeling safe.”\\nAvoiding the bad means you risk avoiding the good, too, and I’d rather\\nbe hurt than never not feel this. I inhale his skin.\\n“And speaking of safe…” I take a deep breath and tilt my head up to\\nlook at him, changing the subject. “Where the hell were you last night?\\nHoled up in a cave? W e were almost electrocuted.”\\nHe smiles and flips me over , trailing kisses down my stomach.\\n“Oh, no.” I stop him, forcing him to look at me. “Now that I have my\\nsenses about me, I’m mad at you. We were worried. Really worried. Say you’re sorry .”\\nHe gives my tummy a peck, holding my eyes.\\n“Again.”\\nHe inches up and kisses me again, a smile in his dark gaze.\\n“I’m still mad.”\\nHe catches my nipple between his teeth and drags it out slowly . I gasp.\\n“You’re just trying to shut me up now,” I grumble, but really , heat is\\npooling low in my belly . “Just because you like me to guess  everything\\nthat’s going on in your head…”\\nHe dives down and starts nibbling and teasing between my legs.\\n“Okay , yes,” I choke out. “Now I know what’ s going through your\\nhead.”\\nI feel his laugh against my clit before he resumes sucking on it.\\nThe sheets are completely off me, and I look over at Noah, passed out\\non his stomach.\\n“Noah is right there,” I mouth to Kaleb.\\nHe stops and cocks an eyebrow at me.\\n“Shut up,” I tell him. “W e weren’ t thinking last night.”\\nI’m well aware we’ve already had sex once with his brother asleep mere\\nfeet away , but I shove Kaleb off and pull the sheet up over me. He can wait\\nuntil we’re alone.\\nHe huffs and crawls back up, lying down and tucking me under his arm.\\nI snuggle in, reveling in his warmth.\\nHe grabs something of f the counter next to the bed and shoves it at me.\\nI hold up the paperback.\\n“What’ s this?” I ask, reading the title. “ The Sir ens of T itan?”\\nI look up at him, and he opens the book to where it’ s dog-eared.\\nHe hands it back to me, pointing.\\n“You want me to read it?” I ask.\\nHe nods.\\nI half-smile. I guess he does read.\\nAnd if I’m not letting him do things to my body , then he’s still making\\nme entertain him, I guess.\\nI remain  under his arm, but flip onto my back and clear my throat.\\n“Chapter ten…”\\n \\n  \\nJerking the wheel right, I plant my foot on the ground, letting the bike skid\\nto a halt before speeding off again toward the house. I laugh  behind my\\nhelmet, feeling Kaleb right on my ass as the dogs chase him, tails wagging.\\nWe’ve been home for a couple weeks now, Noah and I having no\\ntrouble dragging Kaleb back down the mountain. I think he knew I\\nwouldn’ t be comfortable up at the other cabin, and he wasn’ t about to let\\nme go anywhere he wasn’ t going to be.\\nJake plowed and salted the driveway this morning, and when his back\\nwas turned, we took the bikes.\\nI race to the house, my stomach doing somersaults at the wind and\\nspeed, and I brake, coming to a stop. Looking behind me, I watch as Kaleb\\nslides to a halt, the vein in that damn gorgeous neck bulging as his arms\\nflex.\\nI want to go back in the showe r. With him and his hands and all the\\nthings his eyes and smiles whisper to me when we’re alone.\\nI haven’ t slept in my own bed for a single night since we got back.\\n“You two!” I hear Jake bellow .\\nI jerk my head, straightening as he barrels out of the shop. Shit.\\n“Off!” he barks. “Now!”\\nI park the bike and climb of f, trying to hide my smile.\\nHe stalks over to us, looking at the McDougall bikes. “Gre at. Now\\nthey’re dirty,” he growls. “I have to clean them again— No, you know\\nwhat? You’re cleaning them.” He points to Kaleb and then me, too. “You’re\\nboth cleaning them!”\\n“We were going to,” I tell him, taking off my helmet. “You want some\\npancakes or something?”\\nHe cocks an eyebrow and turns  around, ignoring my sudden change in\\nsubject.\\nI throw a look at Kaleb. He just shakes his head.\\nJake’ s moods have spiraled lately , and I’m worried it’s my fault. Is he\\nfeeling guilty? Is he concerned for me? Is he jealous?\\nI haven’ t had a chance to talk to him. Kaleb and I are always together .\\nOr Kaleb makes sure we’re always together .\\nNot that I’d choose to have it any other way. I just hope he trusts that\\nI’m well aware of who I’m in love with, and he doesn’ t need to worry about\\nhis father and brother around me. I jog after Jake. “Are you okay?”\\n“I’m fine.”\\n“I don’ t think you are.”\\nHe heads over to the tool benc h and picks up what he needs before\\nturning to another work-in-progress.\\nHe won’ t look at me.\\n“I’m happy ,” I tell him, because I know that’s what he really cares\\nabout.\\n“I know .”\\nSo what is it, then? I stand there , feeling Kaleb walk past me to the sink.\\nHe washes his hands, but I know he’ s watching us.\\n“Just…don’ t get pregnant,” he finally grits out. “Y ou’re only eighteen.”\\n“I know ,” I assure him. “I won’ t.”\\n“And you’re going to college.”\\n“I will.”\\nI think.\\nHe glares at the bike he’s working on, seething. “And tell that woman,”\\nhe bites out, closing his eyes like the mere mention of her is going to send\\nhim over the edge, “that if she doesn’ t stop calling every other  day just to\\nget in my face and ruin my goddamn peace of mind with all her questions\\nand arrogant little comebacks, that I will burn every cell phone and\\ncomputer in this house, so she can’t ever get a hold of you again! And then\\nI’ll put up an electric fence in time for the snow to melt so she can’t get on\\nthe property!”\\nI fold my lips between my teeth, holding my breath, because my\\nlaughter is about to burst out.\\nSo that’s what’ s wrong. Mirai calls to talk to me, but she calls way more\\noften than is necessary . And if I don’ t answer , she calls his phone.\\nThe best part is…as frustrated as he sounds, he always answers.\\nThey fight every time. No one riles him up so much. Not even us.\\nI choke down my amusement and nod. “I’ll tell her .”\\nHe throws a wrench on the work bench and picks up another . Kaleb and\\nI head into the house.\\n“Change that lightbulb!” Jake yells after us before we close the door .\\nI let out a laugh and Kaleb smiles, placing a peck on my forehead.\\nHe walks to the cabinet and digs out a lightbulb, winking at me as he\\nheads for the staircase. The scent of the cinnamon rolls I put in the oven a half hour ago fills the\\nair, and I shut off the timer , with only seconds left, and dig out the baking\\ndish.\\nShutting off the oven, I set the rolls down on a cooling rack and glance\\nover at Kaleb as he hops onto the railing and then climbs onto a rafter to\\nstart scaling his way up to the chandelier . One bulb has been out for days.\\nMy heart skips a beat, watching him go higher and higher .\\n“Oh, that smells good,” Noah says, entering the kitchen.\\nI spare him a glance, but I can’t take my attention off Kaleb. “Be careful\\nup there,” I call out to him.\\nI finally look away and grab a slicing knife out of the block, cutting the\\nrolls. Noah hangs by the island, staring at me.\\n“So, the snow’ s easing up a little,” he says.\\nI add a little milk to the icing I made this morning and stir it, heating it\\nover an open flame.\\n“Yeah.” It’ s only late February , though, so winter is far from over .\\nI can’ t help but wish it was still November , and winter was just starting.\\n“Is all your coursework done?” he asks.\\nI turn off the burner and carry the icing over to the dish, drippin g it over\\nthe rolls.\\n“They’re waiving my exams, but I have to write an essay and submit it\\nwith a photo journal by April thirtieth.”\\nI see him nod out of the corner of my eye. “I’m going to L.A. this\\nspring,” he says. “I’ve got a meeting with a sponsor , and I want to check out\\nthe scene there. Can I stay with you?”\\nStay with me?\\nAnd then I remember—as if I’d actually forgotten—that I have  a house\\nthere. I told them I was leaving in April, didn’ t I?\\n“Yeah,” I reply , barely audible. “Of course, you can stay at the house.\\nAs long as you want.”\\nI just might not be there.\\nHe may as well use the place, though.\\nHe’s quiet, and I don’t have the courage to look at him. I know he’s\\nworried. Maybe a little angry . He deserves better .\\nHe’s taken the high road through everything. He’s backed off and let me\\nbe happy . But that doesn’ t mean he’s stopped caring. Part of me misses talking to\\nhim, too. He expects differently of me, and he won’ t be happy with me if I\\ndecide to stay behind. Things have changed, though.\\nInching in, he lowers his voice as Kaleb works far above us. “I would\\nfight anyone who wronged my brother ,” he says. “I do love him, Tiernan,\\nbut this life is not for you. Y ou’re leaving with me.”\\nMy chin trembles, because I’m worried that he has a point.\\n“I love you,” he whispers. “As your cousin, as your friend, whatever ,\\nbut I’m draggin g you out of here, because when the novelty of this wears\\noff, you’re going to miss the world. He will make you miserable.”\\nI dart my eyes up to him, the icing pouring all over one roll, and I want\\nhim to stop. How can he say that? That’ s his brother .\\nHis blue eyes narrow on me. “He needs someone braindead who doesn’ t\\ncare about dying in this town where nothing changes except the seasons,”\\nhe tells me. “You might not have cared before, but I know there’s a whole\\nwide world you wouldn’ t mind seeing now. He’s too volatile, too stubborn,\\nand he will never leave this peak, T iernan. Ever .”\\nI look away , blinking against the stinging at the backs of my eyes.\\nDamn you, Noah.\\n“You want more.” He takes the pot out of my hand and sets it down. “I\\nknow you do.”\\nMaybe. Maybe I want to see and experience things and have a career\\nand try to make the world better and leave my mark.\\nOr mayb e none of that would be worthwhile without someone to share\\nit with.\\nI look at Noah, always knowin g in my head that, in many ways, he’s\\nbetter for me.\\nHe’s my head. The part of me that tells me what I already know . What I\\nneed to hear .\\nMy heart, though… It feels everything I can’ t live without.\\nI tip my head back, gazing up at Kaleb as he stares down at us, having\\nfinished the lightbulb.\\n“He’ s your number one,” I hear Noah say. “He’ s not supposed to be the\\none you spend your life with, right?”  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nTwo Months Later\\n \\nI look down at the toilet paper and see red spotting, my should ers instantly\\nrelaxing as I let out a breath.\\nThank God. I laugh to myself and quickly finish up, three days of worry\\nfinally ending.\\nI knew I should’ ve gotten an implant. I’ve been taking my birth  control,\\nbut it’s not as effective as other methods, and being a teen mom is not\\nwhere I want to be right now. The press and Chapel Peak would have a\\nheyday if I came of f this mountain pregnant.\\nI’m not sure how Kaleb would take it, either .\\nIt’s late April, the property is still covered in snow , but the days are\\nwarmer and there are patches of grass. Jake is working on the roads now .\\nThe last two months since we brought Kaleb home have been …like a\\ndream. After Noah got on my case that day in February , I put it all out of\\nmy mind and decided to enjoy what time we had left here. The seclusion,\\nthe peace, and the long nights. I’ve never slept better or been this happy , my\\nnightmares—or night terrors—having stopped long ago. Kaleb and I read,\\nwe all watch movies and play cards, and I taught Noah how to waltz in the\\nliving room on St. Patrick’ s Day. I’ve climbed trees, learned how to make a\\nbelt, and taught myself how to update V an der Ber g Extreme’ s website.\\nI’ve even gotten pretty good on the dirt bikes. We shou ld be able to rejoin the world soon, though, and I’ve never\\nwanted time to pass so slowly . Decisions will need to be made, and I\\nhaven’ t wanted this day to come.\\nI head out of the bathroom and up to our room on the third floor ,\\nhugging myself in my long-slee ved T-shirt as chills spread down my legs,\\nbare in my sleep shorts.\\nMirai is coming tonight, and I’ve been working on making sure the\\nhouse looks as clean and nice as possible, so she doesn’ t have a reason to\\npick a fight with Jake. If she’s able to make it up here, that is. If he can’t get\\nthe roads cleared, she’ll be holed up in a motel in town and have to wait it\\nout.\\nAt least I’m not pregnant, though. And if I were, at least I wouldn’ t be\\nshowing yet. Kaleb and I are on each other every day, sometime s more than\\nonce, and I’ve been lucky my birth control hasn’ t failed. My period being\\nthree days late gave me a good scare.\\nI stop in front of the long mirror I had moved up from my room and turn\\nsideways, running my hand over my stomach. The fitted, white T-shirt is\\nflat and smooth over my tummy , but for a few scary days, I thought part of\\nKaleb might be in there. Part of Kaleb and me.\\nI lift up my shirt, envision my belly growing with his kid and trying to\\nignore the way my body warms at the thought, because I shouldn’ t want\\nthat. It’ s so cliché. Baby makes three and happily-ever -after .\\nI’d love to have  his child, though. Someday . I’d love to be his forever\\nand see him as a father .\\nI close my eyes, shaking my head at myself, because I know the truth. I\\nonly want his kid, because I’m not sure I have him. If I got pregnant, I\\nwouldn’ t have to make any decisions, because my fate would be sealed, and\\nI’d stay . No need to stress.\\nPounding and thuds suddenly hit the stairs, and Noah and Kaleb come\\nrushing through the door, tumbli ng onto the floor and laughing. I freeze, my\\nshirt still up and my hands still on my stomach.\\nTheir laughter dies down, and they lift their heads, looking up at me and\\ntaking me in.\\nI quickly pull my shirt down.\\nKaleb climbs to his feet, staring at me and not blinking, and Noah rises,\\nstanding there in limbo for a moment before he finally decides to leave.\\nKaleb’ s eyes drop to my stomach. “I’m not,” I tell him. “I was just…playing around.”\\nHe thins his eyes on me, and I still see uncertainty there.\\n“My period was late,” I explai n. “I got it this morning. I was just…\\nthinking about…what it… would be… like. I’m…” I run a hand through\\nmy hair . “I’m stupid.”\\nI laugh nervously , caught. I was fantasizing, and now he’s probably\\nworried I’ll sabotage my birth control.\\nBut he steps over to me and places a hand on my stomach, staring at his\\nfingers as they splay across my belly . A flutter hits me, and I almost feel\\ndizzy .\\nWe lock eyes, and before I know it, he takes my hand and leads me\\ndown the stairs.\\n“Kaleb,” I protest. What is he doing?\\nHe walks me into the bathroom and opens the medicine cabine t, taking\\nmy birth control out.\\nTurning, he looks down into my eyes, so many emotions crossing his\\nface. He opens his mouth, and I hold my breath, because it looks like he’s\\ngoing to speak.\\nHis breath fans across my lips, and he holds me, kissing my forehead,\\nnose, and mouth.\\nAnd then, he holds my eyes and drops the pills into the trash.\\n“Kaleb, no.” I dive down and snatch them back out.\\nHe tries to pry them from my hand, but I keep hold. I rest my forehead\\nagainst his mouth, closing my eyes and almost smiling. He want s us to have\\na baby . He wouldn’ t be mad or feel trapped at all.\\nHe wants me.\\nThat’ s all I wanted to know .\\n“I don’t want to leave you ever, but…” I look up at him. “We’re too\\nyoung. We’re too… Too much shit we’ve been through. We’re not ready\\nyet.”\\nHe slowly tugs the pills more and more, and I struggle to keep  hold of\\nthem.\\n“I love you,” I whisper . “We have our whole lives.”\\nHe kisse s me, his mouth moving  stronger and deeper as he takes hold of\\nmy face with one hand and tries to pry the pills away with another . His\\ntongue swirls like a cyclone down to my toes, and I whimper , my muscles going weak. I lose the pills and the next second I hear them drop into the\\ntrash again.\\nHe wraps his arms around me, and I don’t realize he’s carrying me until\\nhe lays me on our bed upstairs.\\nHe always gets his way . Damn him.\\nI make a mental note to go dig the pills out again before Jake burns the\\ntrash.\\n \\n \\nKaleb and I stare at each other as he takes a bite of chicken and feeds me\\nthe other half of the piece. I sit in his lap at the table, trying to hide my\\nsmile, but he can’ t, because he’ s grinning like we have a secret.\\nWhich we do. We’re not actually trying to get pregnant, are we? I\\nhaven’ t dug the pills out yet, but leaving him is the last thing I want to do. It\\nseems nice, the idea of building a family with him. He’s almost twenty-two.\\nHe seems ready for it all.\\nI let out a breath, eating a forkf ul of scrambled egg and loadin g up the\\nutensil again, feeding him some. Breakfast is a hodgepodge of leftovers\\nbecause we climbed back in bed this morning, and I didn’ t have time for\\nanything else.\\nI guess we’re technically not making a baby yet. I just started my\\nperiod, and I can’t get pregnant for the next several days, anyway . I can still\\ngo back on my pill.\\n“Well, that’s it,” Jake says, strolling into the kitchen and whipping off\\nhis gloves, tossing them and his keys onto the counter . “The roads are\\nopen.”\\nA bike speeds off outside, and I guess that’s Noah, not wasting any time\\nto go see his friends.\\nI drop my eyes, though, my stomach sinking a little. I’d rather have\\nmore winter . I look at Kaleb, seeing him watch me, and right now, I’m half-\\ntempted to drag him into the garage, pack up the snowmobiles, and run to\\nthe fishing cabin . The snow up there will last for another month. Another\\nblissful month of quiet.\\n“Where’ s that woman sleeping tonight?” Jake asks.\\nHe turns to face us with his cof fee in his hand. Oh, that’s right.  We can’t escape to the cabin anyway . Now that the\\nroads are clear , Mirai can stay here at the house tonight.\\n“My room.” I climb off Kaleb and clear our empty plate. “Thank you\\nfor…welcoming her ,” I tell Jake.\\nHe looks down at me, his eyes hooded in aggravation. “I’d rather have a\\nfew more months of winter .”\\nAnd he leaves, disappearing into the shop.\\nYeah.\\nI agree.\\n \\n \\nScooping out a hefty serving of Swedish Fish, I dump them in the white\\npaper bag and close the container .\\nI have Peach Rings, cinnamon bears, gourmet jellybeans, and Spencer is\\nboxing up some chocolate-covered almond clusters for me now .\\nI glance out the window , seeing Kaleb across the street, loadin g some\\nlumber into the truck bed. He’s going to try his hand at carpentry  by making\\nus a headboard, and I’m going to paint it.\\nI wish he hadn’ t insisted on coming to town with me. After what\\nhappened at the bar on my birthday , it’s only a matter of time before the\\npolice—or the Motocross guys—get a whif f of his presence in town.\\nSome giggles go off near me, and I look over the jar of Hot Tamales to\\nsee a couple of young women by the retro-candy collection glancing at me\\nand whispering.  They round the aisle, their eyes dropping down  my clothes,\\nand then they laugh to themselves before leaving again.\\nI look down at myself, puzzled. I’m not dressed weird.\\nAlthough I am wearing Noah’ s muddy old riding boots, and my jeans\\nare a little dirty from chores this morning.\\nAfter Jake cleared the roads, we decided to get dressed, get our\\nindividual jobs done, and get to town. Best to rip off the Band-Aid quickly\\nand get used to being in the world again. We met up with Noah for\\ncheesebur gers, stocked up on gas in case another storm comes in, and hit\\nthe grocery store, loading up on all the fresh produce.\\nKaleb went to the hardware store, and I detoured for candy .\\nI stare at my clothes. I’m not so out of place. Maybe less manicured\\nthan I was in September , but… I look down at my nails, seeing the dirt underneath, and the little cuts on\\nmy hands from all the labor I’ve been up to over the winter .\\nOkay , I’m not manicured at all anymore. I catch myself in the mirror on\\nthe back of a shelf, seeing the loose threads in my dark blue cable knit\\nsweater that also has a black stain from lying too close to a fire. My hair\\ndesperately needs a trim, and I’m tan from being outside, my freckles\\npopping like never before.\\nI haven’ t worn make-up or straightened my hair in months. Mirai won’ t\\nrecognize me.\\nI laugh and head to the register .\\n“My mom told me to bring home a girl like you someday ,” someone\\nsays.\\nI look over, setting my bag on the counter as a young guy approaches\\nme. Spencer weighs my bag, and I study the stranger . He looks vaguely\\nfamiliar . One of Noah’ s friends?\\n“You’re their cousin, right,” he asks, leaning on the glass candy case.\\n“Noah and Kaleb V an der Ber g?”\\nI nod, seeing Spencer hand me the candy again. “I’ll put it on your tab,”\\nhe says.\\nI smile. My tab.  Cool.\\nTurning my attention back to the guy, I hold out my hand. “Tiernan,\\nhey.”\\nHe shakes it. “Kenneth.” He stares at my face. “Would you like to get\\nsome pizza?”\\nOh. Uh… I open my mouth to refuse, but then someone is there, pulling\\nmy hand away out of Kenneth’ s. I look up to see Kaleb glaring down at\\nhim, the blond guy standing up straight and drawing in a breath like he\\nknows to back of f.\\nKaleb threads his fingers through mine and leads me away from the\\nhandsome young man, out the door , and across the street.\\n“He’ s just flirting,” I tease.\\nKaleb’ s eyebrow cocks, and his lips twist to the side.\\n“I know , right?” I joke. “It’ s hard work, guarding a beauty like me.”\\nHe snorts, and I smile as we stop at the truck.\\n“I gotch a some candy worms.” I dangle the bag in front of him, but he’s\\nnot the least bit interested. Taking my face in his hands, he steals a kiss instead, and I revel in his smooth chin, jaw, and cheek. I love to kiss him.\\nEspecially when he’ s clean-shaven.\\n“Come on. We’re going to be late,” I tell him, reaching for the door\\nhandle.\\nHe moves to open the door for me but stops, his eyes rising and looking\\nover my shoulder , the color draining from his face.\\nI follow his gaze.\\nCici Diggins strolls past us, her steps slowing and her eyes locked on\\nKaleb.\\nBut my stare falls to her stomach. Her pregnant stomach.\\nMy lungs empty . No.\\nI jerk my eyes to Kaleb, seeing his jaw flex and his chest rise and fall in\\nshallow breaths. How far along is she? We’ve been away from town for six\\nmonths.\\nUnless she’s carrying twins, she’s farther along than that, which would\\nmean…\\nIs it Kaleb’ s?\\nI can’ t swallow . I can’ t breathe.\\nI look over my shoulder again to see her saunter up to us. “Let me\\nguess,” she says. “Y ou’re going through the math in your head right now?”\\nShe smirks, looking between us. “We’ll be in touch,” she whispers to\\nKaleb.\\nShe walks away , and I blink, trying to keep the tears away . Please. I\\nhold my stomach because it hurts. Not this.\\n“Kaleb?” I murmur .\\nShe was pregnant before the snow . She was pregnant well before the\\nsnow .\\nBut he says nothing, simply opening the truck door and ushering me\\ninside quickly .\\nHe slams the door, rounds the front of the vehicle, and climbs into the\\ndriver ’s side, speeding off toward home. The lumber in the bed bangs\\nagainst the tailgate, and the groceries spill in the backseat.\\nI hold the handle bar above the door, staring over at him. “Did you know\\nshe was pregnant?” I asked.\\nHis knuckles turn white as he grips the steering wheel, and he won’ t\\nlook at me.\\n“She’ s been pregnant a while. Is it yours?” Still, nothing. Did he know? He seemed surprised. But maybe that’s\\nwhat she was upset about in the cave that day. She was pregn ant, and he\\ndidn’ t want her .\\nAnger curdles inside me, and I breathe hard. “Did you know?” I\\ndemand. “Did you know last fall?”\\nHe punches the gas, taking us across the train tracks, toward the\\nhighway leading home.\\nIf it’s his, Cici will be in our lives forever . She’ll have his first child, not\\nme. I’ll never have that.\\nWon’t he say anything? Nod or shake his head? Why won’ t he do\\nanything? I know he can!\\n“Just let me out,” I choke out, the tears threatening. “Stop the truck.”\\nHe keeps driving.\\n“Stop the truck!” I yell.\\nFinally , he looks at me, shaking his head.\\n“No?” I say. “No, what? Talk. I know you know how! Is the baby\\nyours?”\\nJust communica te. Do something! But he keeps his mouth closed, and\\nI’ve had enough.\\nSliding over, I punch the brake, stalling the truck, and he swerves the\\nwheel as it comes to a stop. I hop out, seeing him follow .\\nHe stops me at the front of the car , coming in for me.\\nBut I back away . “No,” I tell him. No kissing. No holding. “Speak.\\nRight now . Is it yours? Did you know?”\\nHe draws in quick, shallow breaths, staring at me, speechless. If he\\ndidn’ t know , then he could shake his head, and I wouldn’ t hate him. We\\ncould go from there.\\nIf he knew , maybe he kept it quiet because he knew he’d be up on the\\nmountain all winter , and mayb e he didn’ t anticipate we’d fall in love.\\nMaybe he thought he could run from this like he runs from everything.\\nJust talk to me.\\nHis beautiful green gaze falls to the space between us, and there’ s\\nnothing he wants to say to me.\\nThe whir of an engine grows louder , and I know it’s Noah on his way\\nhome.\\nHe pulls  up next to us, planting  his shoes on the ground. “Hey , what’ s\\ngoing on?” I give Kaleb four more seconds, waiting for him to do or say anything.\\nWhen he doesn’ t, I climb on the bike behind Noah and wrap my arms\\naround him.\\n“Let’ s go.” I bury my head in his back. “Hurry .”\\nWe speed of f, and for the first time, Kaleb doesn’ t pull me back to him.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI run up the stairs of the deck, breezing past my uncle and all the\\ncommotion in the shop as I hear the truck tires grind the gravel behind me. I\\npick up my pace.\\nNoah made good on his threat to put me on the website and scheduled\\nan impromptu photoshoot with the motorcycles. I won’ t take good pictures\\ntoday , but at least it keeps me away from Kaleb.\\nI wipe the tear from my face.\\n“What’ s wrong?” I hear Jake ask.\\n“I don’t know ,” Noah tells him as I hurry for the front door. “She ran\\naway from Kaleb.”\\n“Tiernan!” my uncle shouts.\\n“Let’ s just do this,” I call out, swinging open the door. Where’ s the\\nphotographer?\\nAn SUV  and a Jeep sit parked  in the driveway , and I know they’re\\nsetting up lighting and such in the garage, but I should take a moment to\\ncompose myself.\\nI need to get in my room— my room—and lock the goddamn door for a\\nfew minutes.\\nWhy was he in such a hurry to toss my birth control this morning? He\\ndidn’ t even think about it. He didn’t hesitate. It was like a lightbulb went on\\nand the solution to a problem he’d been facing finally occurred to him.\\nI stalk through the living room,  but a hand wraps around my arm and\\npulls me around. I jerk out of Kaleb’ s hold, glaring at him through watery eyes.\\n“Kaleb, stop,” his father orders, entering the house.\\nNoah follows. “What happened with you two?”\\nBut I just stare at Kaleb. “This is why you wanted me pregnan t,” I tell\\nhim. “Y ou wanted to trap me before I found out about her .”\\n“Pregnant?” Jake repeats. He darts his eyes to Kaleb. “What did you\\ndo?”\\nKaleb’ s face is flushed, sweat glistens on his neck, and his eyes look\\npained. He’ s wrecked.\\nAnd quiet. Always quiet, because if he doesn’ t have to address any\\nproblems, then they don’ t exist.\\nI barely have the strength to breathe. “Even now, you won’ t talk to me,”\\nI say quietly .\\nJake inches in. “Are you pregnant?”\\n“No.” I shake my head, my sadness turning to anger as I look at Kaleb.\\n“Thank God,” I spit out.\\nKaleb steps in, hovering over me with an edge to his expressi on. He’s\\nmad now .\\nNoah pulls him back. “Kaleb, back of f her.”\\nJake presses a hand into his chest.\\nBut Kale b throw s them off, grow ling, and I back up, tears welling again\\nas he swoops in and picks me up, holds my face and forces his mouth on\\nmine. I choke down a sob, the assault of his scent reminding me how happy\\nwe were just this morning.\\nBefore we came back to the world.\\nI push him away , crying out as Noah and Jake pull him of f me.\\nI breathe hard, falling to my feet and backing up, farther away from\\nhim.\\n“Cici Diggins is pregnant,” I tell Jake and Noah. “V ery pregnant.”\\nKaleb doesn’ t look at anyone but me, but I see Jake and Noah staring at\\nme, stunned.\\n“It could be anybody’ s,” Noah ar gues.\\n“Yours?”\\n“No,” he retorts like I’m crazy . “God, no. I didn’ t sleep with her .”\\n“Did she say it was Kaleb’ s?” Jake straightens, releasing his son.\\n“She didn’ t have to,” I tell him, but I lock eyes with Kaleb. If it’s his, I might learn to live with it, even though that means living\\nwith her in our lives.\\nIf he knew about it all along, though…\\n“Say something,” I tell him. “Say something to me.”\\nAnything, please.\\n“Or write something, then,” I ask. “Tell me anything. Tell me you love\\nme.”\\nHe just stands there, though.\\nAnd I stop crying, my heart broken but not. Maybe it’s just not there\\nanymore, because I draw in a deep breath, knowing someone will have his\\nkids, but it will never be me. I can’t live in another house where someone I\\nlove won’ t talk to me.\\n“We’re all set,” I hear a woman say from the kitchen.\\nIt only takes a moment, but I blink away the tears and follow her into\\nthe shop, desperate to get away .\\n“Let’ s get you ready ,” she chirps.\\nI nod, pushing Kaleb and Cici out of my mind.\\nThey change me into a pair of short jean shorts and a black off-the-\\nshoulder top that shows my belly. I sit down to have my hair styled and my\\nmake-up done, Noah having accounted for everything when bringing\\npeople up here, I guess. I feel like I’m on one of my parents’ movie sets.\\n“Not too much,” the blue-haired photographer tells the make-up artist.\\n“I want natural.  I want her to look like someone the average guy can get\\ninto bed with.”\\nSomeone clears their throat behind us.\\n“Kidding,” the lady quickly replies, and I guess Jake is standing behind\\nme.\\nThen to the artist again, she says, “You catch my drift, though , right?\\nPretty , not porno.”\\nThe man with short-cropped blond hair and tattoos on his finge rs nods,\\nblending concea ler under my eyes, probably to get rid of the splotchiness\\nfrom my crying.\\nThe stylist fluffs my waves, sprays my hair, and I open my mouth,\\nstretching my face, because I haven’ t worn make-up in so long, it’s like\\ncake on my face.\\nNoah pulls up a stool and plops down, waggling his eyebrows at me as\\nthe stylist moves to his head next. “Keep Kaleb away from me,” I tell him in a low voice, but it’s more a\\nbeg.\\n“Sure.” He sighs. “I was in the mood to bleed today .”\\nI give him a sad smile. We finish readying, and I move, as if on auto-\\npilot. Mirai is flying in tonight,  and whether or not she’ll recognize me is\\nirrelevant. She’ll know things happened here, and I won’ t blame her for not\\nunderstanding. I don’ t think I do myself anymore.\\nI’m hurt, but at least I’m leaving stronger than when I came.\\n“Noah?” the photographer named Juno calls.\\nI straddle the dirt bike, spotting Kaleb’ s black T-shirt off to my left by\\nthe shop doors, but I don’t dare look. Noah climbs on the bike behind me,\\njeans and bare chest, because we’re supposed to look sexy as if this image\\nis supposed to have any basis in reality . Motocross racers will probably\\nlaugh and pick apart our lack of proper attire and equipment, but sex sells,\\nI’m told.\\nSo here we go.\\nHe fits behind me, placing his hands on my hips. Kaleb shifts off to my\\nleft, and I think Jake steps in, stopping him.\\nI lean back into Noah, the air hitting my bare stomach as I arch my back\\na little.\\n“Not too close,” someone tells Juno. “She’ s his cousin.”\\nNoah snorts, his chest shaking against my back.\\nI clench my teeth. “It’ s not funny .”\\n“It’s hilarious.”\\nI roll my eyes. I guess I should laugh, too, or I’ll cry. The cousins in this\\nhouse are so much closer than they realize. My hips are the least of what\\nNoah has touched.\\nBefore I can stop myself, my gaze flashes to Kaleb. He leans against the\\ndoorframe, his arms crossed over his chest, and his expression more pained\\nthan I’ve seen it. He stares at us—at me—like something he’s already lost,\\nand he hasn’ t the slightest clue how to get back what he wants  most in the\\nworld.\\nAll he has to do is talk. Find a way to communicate.\\nI let my eyes fall as I cock my head to the side and turn it for a candid\\nshot, because I can’ t look at the camera in case I’ve ruined my mascara.\\n“I love that, T iernan,” Juno coos. “Y ou look amazing, honey .” I rest my hands on my thighs, lifting my chin a little. I guess the point of\\nthis is to feature  the young faces  of Van der Berg Extreme, and Noah knew\\nthis wasn’ t Kaleb’ s thing. I’m glad it’s Noah behind me, though. He’s who\\nI’m safe with.\\n“Look at him now ,” Juno tells me.\\nMy throat tightens, and I’m overwhelmed. I take some deep breaths,\\ntrying to get my head back in the game.\\n“Look at me, T iernan,” Noah whispers.\\nSlowly , I look up, meeting his eyes over my shoulder .\\nThe photographer snaps some shots.\\n“We’re not letting you go,” he murmurs to me, so no one else can hear.\\n“This is family .”\\nI can’t help but smile. For better or worse, I’m not escaping them, am I?\\nThis is family .\\nThey won’ t run from me, and no matter what happens with Kaleb and\\nme, I love Jake and Noah, too. They lend credence every day to what\\nhappened to me and to my need to be in this. They validated me when I had\\nnothing.\\nJake was holding onto his past and punishing himself, just like me.\\nNoah had no one to talk to, just like me. Kaleb struggles to connect,\\nbecause of his pain of being forgotten by someone who shou ld’ve loved\\nhim enough to never  forget.\\nJust like me.\\nThey lend truth to the fact that I was lost, and it was okay to be hurt. We\\nfound each other , and no matter what anyone would say about what\\nhappened up here this winter , I’m the only one who needs to understand.\\n“Lean into him, T iernan,” Juno instructs.\\nI do as she says and lean into Noah, looking up at him, a small grin I\\ncan’t help but feel spreading across my lips. He winks at me.\\n“That’ s good.” A few more snaps go off. “Now , Noah, look off to the\\nside and down.”\\nHe hesitates, but finally , he looks away , looking like Kaleb as he stares\\noff like the tortured hero.\\n“Oh, that’ s great. Y ou both look great!”\\nI slide off the bike and climb on behind him now, spreading my knees\\nand placing my hands on his waist.\\n“Looking good,” Juno says, moving around us to take more shots. I hear someone giggle and look up to see a few more people have\\narrived, racers and their girlfri ends whom I vaguely remember hanging\\naround the shop last fall.\\nOne girl stands next to Kaleb and stares at him, looking nervous but\\nsmitten.\\nI gulp. At least he’ s not paying her any mind.\\n“Now , Noah, off the bike,” Juno says. “Tiernan, I want you to lean\\nforward and grab the handlebar s. Noah, do the same from the other side,\\nstraddle the front wheel, and challenge each other . Kind of like siblings.”\\nNoah laughs again but follows orders. I scoot up in the seat, both feet on\\nthe ground, while Noah plants both legs on either side of the front wheel\\nand leans into me, holding the handles.\\n“Tiernan, can you arch your back?” she asks.\\nI do, jutting out my butt a little more as the muscles in my thighs flex.\\n“More, honey .”\\nI sigh, trying to lean forward more and stick out my ass.\\nBut Noah urges me further . “More,” he whispers. “Like you’ve got a\\nman behind you.”\\nI arch an eyebrow . Leave it to him to make some sexual joke right now .\\nI dart my gaze to Kaleb, seein g his eyes crinkled at the edges as he\\nwatches us. The girl has moved away a step, but she’ s still swooning.\\nNo short supply of women to take his mind off me once I’m gone, I\\nguess.\\n“You ready to go to L.A.?” I ask Noah as Juno takes our picture.\\n“I’ve been ready . You?” he chall enges. “You ready to get the fuck out of\\nthis dump?”\\nI want to shoot him a look, but I don’ t want to lose the shot.\\n“I don’ t want him to be angry with you,” I tell Noah, referring to Kaleb.\\nIf I leave with Noah, Kaleb will assume the wrong thing.\\n“If he wants to follow us and bring you back, then maybe that’s what he\\nneeds to do,” Noah retorts. “If not, I get you to myself. W in, win.”\\nI fluff my hair and adjust my stance. “You don’t want me. You want to\\nrace.”\\n“I’d love my family with me, though.”\\nYeah.\\nI can do that.\\n“I’m not letting you go,” I tell him. He smiles. But then he stops, remembering himself.\\nHe glances off toward Kaleb and then back to me. “He’ s five seconds\\nfrom rearranging my face.”\\nI could care less if Kaleb is angry .\\n“Ugh, doesn’ t that just take the cake?” someone says somewhere by the\\ndoors. “I love women in that position. All she’ s gotta do is hold it like that.”\\nSomeone chuckles, but I don’ t know who. I ignore them.\\n“She’ s carrying herself a little hotter than last fall,” the same guy says.\\n“Wonder what changed?”\\n“I don’t know , but I’m wishing I was locked up here with her all\\nseason,” the other man adds.\\nThere’ s a shuffle, a gasp, and then all hell breaks loose as a table topples\\nover and shouting ensues.\\n“Kaleb!” Jake shouts.\\nI shoot up, watching as Kaleb throws one of the racers down on the\\nfloor of the shop and Jake rushes in to haul his son back. Juno and the\\nstylists rear back, out of the way, and the girls who came with the guys\\nstumble out into the driveway .\\nI climb off the bike, seeing Noah rush over and keep Kaleb back as his\\ndad picks up the guy of f the ground.\\n“Motherfucker!” the guy growls at Kaleb.\\nBut Jake pushes him and his friend out of the shop. “Hit the road,” he\\ntells them. “Closed shoot, you little shits!”\\nThose must’ve been the jerks making remarks.\\nKaleb goes after him again, but Jake is quick to catch him. “Stop!” he\\nyells. “Stop it right now .”\\nHe points in his son’s face, but Kaleb is seething. The racers take their\\ngirls, climb on their bikes, and speed off, everyone in the shop standing\\naround, shaken.\\nFinally , Jake just waves them off. “Alright, that’s enough,” he bites out.\\n“We’ve got what we need.”\\nJuno nods and turns off her camera, everyone hurrying to close up shop\\nand gather their equipment.\\nKaleb stalks toward me.\\nBut Jake grabs him again. “No,” he says. “Get in the truck. Now .”\\nHe glares at Kaleb, pushing him out of the shop.\\nKaleb stumbles back, staring at me. “Now!” Jake fires at him again.\\nI can see the vein in Kaleb’ s neck bulging from here, and he hesitates,\\nbut… he leaves, heading into the driveway .\\n“You, too,” Jake orders Noah.\\nNoah grabs his T -shirt and follows his brother out to the truck.\\nJake charges over to me. He stops close, keeping his voice down as\\nmuch as he’ s capable since there’ s still people around. “I’m going to go deal\\nwith the sherif f, and I’m taking them to the fucking bar to sort some shit\\nout.”\\n“A bar ,” I grit out. “And I have to stay here?”\\n“Yes.” He glowers at me. “Don’ t leave the house, or you’ll be sorry .”\\n“What did I do?” I fire back. “I don’t want to be stuck here all night\\nwhile you’re all out, shopping for tail!”\\n“You’ll stay here, because Kaleb’s not going to leave you alone if I\\ndon’t get him away from you!” he barks, not caring who hears us now . “You\\nhaven’ t been separated from him for more than two months, and everyone\\nneeds a few hours of space. I’m doing this for you. Take a shower . Calm\\ndown.”\\nI shake my head . He thinks a shower is going to solve this? I have every\\nright to be upset. I won’ t calm down.\\nHe pauses, relaxing his shoulders and checking himself.\\n“I need to talk to him, Tiernan,” he says, softening his tone. “I need to\\nmake sure there isn’t a warrant out for him, and we need to talk to the\\nDiggins girl. Y ou need to stay here. W e’ll be back later .”\\nAnd I watch as he leaves, fishing his keys out of his pocket.\\nI stand there, even after the photographer and stylists have left and I’m\\nall alone in the house, knowing  that Kaleb and I only have one problem,\\nand the only thing that will solve it wasn’ t on Jake’ s agenda tonight.\\nIt’s something his father can’t take care of for him. It has to come from\\nKaleb.\\n \\n \\nSee you soon.\\nI stare at the text from Mirai that came in four hours ago as she was\\nboarding a plane at LAX. She can’t come here. Kaleb has no restraint. He won’ t care about\\nappearances, he’ll scare her , and she’ll try to drag me out of here.\\nStanding by my bed, I look down at my half-filled suitcase that I started\\npacking when the text came in. At first, I threw in a few clothes to stay with\\nher at the motel in town, just to keep her away from here.\\nThen, I started packing more than I needed, and I wasn’ t sure why.\\nMaybe Jake was right to take them out tonight, so we could all have space.\\nMaybe space is exactly what everyone needs right now. I could go home for\\na bit. There’ s texting, email, FaceT ime… I’ll stay in touch. I could say I’m\\ntaking Noah to get him settled at my house while he meets with sponsors\\nand just take the opportunity to get some air myself. Some perspective.\\nBut I stopped packing when I realized I wouldn’ t come back. Not unless\\nKaleb came for me himself.\\nAm I prepared to draw that line?\\nTonight?\\nSticking my phone in my back  pocket, I head up to Kaleb’ s room to\\nclean out anythi ng I’ll need in the immediate future. Lightning  flashes out\\nthe window as I enter his room, and I turn on the lamp, the smell of the\\nwood, fire, and books like home now, because I’ve spent countless hours in\\nthis room over recent months.\\nPicking up the tattered hardback  on his bedside table, I open it to where\\na pencil  is stuck inside and look at the sketch I saw him work ing on one\\nnight. Me in the shower , water spilling over my top half as I rinse my hair .\\nI told him that I read some of his journal entries, and while he wasn’ t\\nupset, I haven’ t seen him write any more since. When he does dive into the\\nflyleafs, he just draws now .\\nI assure d him I wouldn’ t read more, unless he wanted me to, but he\\ndoesn’ t feel safe. In some ways, he opened up more with me. In others, he\\nretreated.\\nI pick up the pencil and start writing on the opposite page.\\n \\nNoah said something a couple of months ago. He said you wer e my first,\\nand if I followed  my mother ’s advice, then I wasn’ t supposed to end up with\\nyou.\\n \\nRain starts hittin g the roof and lightning strikes again, followed by a roll\\nof thunder .  \\nBut at the time,  in my head, you weren’t the first. You were the one I\\nshould be with, because I finall y liked myself, and I liked how you pushed\\nme, because it made me push back. Y ou made me learn how to demand.\\nAnd for that, I’ll always be grateful.\\n \\nI can’t take any more than short, shallow breaths, because a lump lodges\\nin my throat.\\n \\nYou’re at the bar with them now, and I’m alone in your room, knowing I\\nshould keep packing my suitcase but not wanting to, because the highs with\\nyou ar e so good. I don’ t want it to stop.\\nBut the lows…\\nThe lows ar e like I’m nine again and still waiting for them to love me.\\n \\nI can’ t keep being grateful for the scraps. I need more from him.\\n \\nYou won’ t change, and the botto m line is… I won’ t stay. You’re not my\\nparents. You don’t ignor e me. But you’r e punishing me. You wield the only\\npower you have, and I don’t know why I thought I could get more out of\\nyou, because if you didn’ t talk to Noah and Jake for seventeen  years, why\\nwould you talk for me?\\nMaybe it’s about contr ol. A way to dominate us. I don’t know , but it\\nhurts.\\nI think you loved  me, though. And I love you. I was yours that first night\\nwhen you took me in your arms  in the shop, and you didn’ t even know my\\nname. It was a rough road we traveled to get here, and I knew you were the\\none even then.\\n \\nI look up at the ceiling, listening to the storm. Kaleb was rain. Passion, a\\nscream, and my hair sticking to my face as I wrapped my arms around him.\\nSpontaneous and loud all over my skin.\\nHe was whispe rs, too, though. Snow , firelight, and searching for his\\nwarmth between the sheets at two a.m. when the rest of the house is asleep.\\n \\nRemember the three L’s I talked about—Lust, Learn, and Love? There’s\\nanother one. One my mother didn’ t tell me about, and I’m not sure wher e it fits, but I know it’ s necessary .\\nI need some time alone to hear myself.\\nIt’s time to Listen.\\n \\nMy head  and heart are both saying the same things. I need more from\\nhim. I stick the pencil in the book and close it, laying it on his bed before\\nturning of f the lamp.\\nClosing the door , I head downstairs, texting my uncle on the way .\\n \\nI’m picking up Mirai at the airport.\\n \\nHe just doesn’ t need to know I’ve decided to keep us at the motel in\\ntown. It’s a wise choice, anyway . The peak could get snowed in again, and I\\ndon’t think she and Jake need to be locked up in such close proximity .\\nI toss some toiletries into the suitcase and close it up, carrying it\\ndownstairs. Setting it by the door, I pull on my rain boots and coat, hearing\\nthe dogs barking out in the barn.\\nI walk over to the window and look outside. It’s not like they aren’ t\\nused to thunder up here. What are they barking at?\\nThe door to the stable swings open and closed in the wind, the light left\\non and casting a glow as the rain pours. Mud puddles dance as drops hit,\\nand I buckle up my raincoat, heading out the shop door .\\nI walk across the room, opening the bay door and stepping outside.\\nRunning to the stable, I squeal as water hits my jeans, and I dash inside,\\nthrowing of f my hood.\\nDanny howls as Johnny runs up to me, and I give him a quick pet,\\nhearing Shawne e thrashing in her stall. She whinnies, jumping up and\\ndown, her hooves hitting the wooden door .\\nWhat the hell?\\nI run over, grabbing her mane and pulling her down to me. I stroke her\\nnose.\\n“Hey , hey, it’s just rain.” I chuckle, giving her a good rub. “You’ve gotta\\nbe used to storms by now .”\\n“It’s not the storm upsetting her ,” someone says.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI twist around, my heart thunder ing in my chest as a hooded figure steps out\\nof the next stall. Smoke billows into the air as he drops a cigarette to the\\nground and grinds it out on the cement.\\nThe overhead light swings back and forth in the breeze, casting him in\\nshadow every few moments.\\n“Who—?”\\nBut I stop as he slips off the hood of his jacket, and I see Terrance\\nHolcomb turn to face me. Rain  has darkened his sweatshirt and glistens\\nacross his face as he looks me up and down.\\nNo.\\nI didn’t hear bikes approach. There are no vehicles outside. He arrived\\nundetected.\\nHe snuck in here.\\nQuickly , I glance around for anyone else and take a step back, toward\\nthe exit.\\n“We didn’ t invite you on the property ,” I bite out. “No one wants to see\\nyou here.”\\n“There’ s no one here except you, though,” he says, eerily calm. “You’re\\nall alone, right?”\\nKeeping my eyes locked on him, I reach over and pull a rake off the\\nwall that I can see hanging there out of the corner of my eye while slowly\\nreaching behind me to pull my phone out of my back pocket. His eyes are\\nfixed on my weapon. He chuckles, stepping toward me as I step back. “At least it’s not a\\nshotgun,” he jokes, and I remember Kaleb and Noah, armed and rushing to\\nthe pond to get me away from this guy all those months ago. “It’s cute how\\nthey try to protect you.”\\n“They don’ t have to.” I squeeze the long handle. “Leave.”\\n“What if I came just to talk to you?”\\n“By lurking in our stable on a dark, rainy night?”\\nYeah. This isn’t a social visit. He either saw the Van der Bergs in town\\nwithout me and seized his opportunity , or he’s been here, waiting for them\\nto leave.\\nI retreat another step, his boot crawling heel to toe and approaching.\\n“Kaleb is going to be charged over the damage he did to those bikes last\\nNovember ,” he says.\\nI press the powe r button on my phone and try to swipe in my security\\npattern behind my back, listening for the small click over the rain that tells\\nme it’ s unlocked.\\n“And yet, you’re here and not the sherif f,” I point out.\\nI try a few more times, my fingers shaking, but I finally hear the click.\\n“I’ll say it was an accident,” he tells me. “I’ll take his side and back him\\nup.”\\n“What makes you think I care?” I tap the screen where I know my\\nphone icon is located.\\nTerrance grins knowingly . “Eve ryone saw you two in town today ,” he\\nreplies. “It was really a no-bra iner. Women love assholes, especially the\\nquiet ones. He was always going to have you, even if just a piece.”\\nMy chest is too heavy to breathe. He tries to close the distance between\\nus, and I retreat, the rain growing heavier outside the door behind me.\\n“You sponsor me, and I will not pursue him,” Terrance proposes. “I’ll\\nget the sherif f and my team to back off, and you and he can live happily\\never after .”\\n“You have a sponsor .”\\n“I had a sponso r,” he retorts. “They pulled their support when Kaleb\\ndestroyed the bikes.”\\nI cock my head,  leveling my eyes on him. Kaleb caused some damage,\\nso he lost his sponsor? Really?\\nHe shrugs, know ing I’m not buying it. “And they got wind of some\\nother things, too,” he admits. I nod. Yeah. Like his clubhouse, maybe. Or any one of a millio n shady\\nthings I’m sure he’s up to, because he’s a sleazebag. A reputab le business\\ndoesn’ t want him representing them.\\nKaleb may be fined—he’ll definitely have to pay damages—but he’s\\nnot getting arrested.\\n“So what do you say?” he asks.\\nI hold his eyes.\\nHe doesn’t want to hear no. He came up here when he knew I’d be\\nalone, because he’ s prepared to coerce me.\\nWill he leave if I lie and agree?\\nA ring pierces the air, my phon e vibrating in my hand, and my heart\\nstops.\\nHe bolts for me, and I throw the rake at him before spinning around and\\ndashing for the house. I splash through puddles, rain pummeling my head,\\nthe storm  heavi er now, and I don’t look behind me as I cry out and race\\nthrough the open bay doors, into the dark shop, and up the steps to the\\nhouse.\\nSwinging the door open, I barrel inside and answer the phone , seeing\\nJake’ s name on the screen.\\nI hold it up to my ear but see a dark form in the kitchen and stop,\\ndropping my hand.\\nMy lungs empty .\\n“Hello?” I hear my uncle on the other end of the phone.\\nBut I look around, my attention only on the two other men in the\\nkitchen whom I don’ t know . I can’ t get a good look at them in the dim light.\\n“Hello?” Jake calls out again.\\n“Get out!” I shout, more to alert Jake than order the strange guys.\\nMy stom ach churns, and I circle the island, pushing pots and pans at\\nthem to keep them back. Why would he bring back-up? What is he\\nplanning?\\nI don’t want them to know someone is on the phone or they’ll take it. I\\nstick it in my pocket, leaving it connected.\\nTerrance charges in the same way I came, breathing hard and his blue\\neyes look at me, almost amused. I stare at the three of them.\\n“Just think about it,” he press es. “You’ll control the purse strings,\\nmeaning you’ll control me and my racing. I’m good for other things, too…\\nwhen you want.” I shake my head. He thinks that’s where this is going? I’ll support his\\nendeavors, because I’m a pathetic, rich little orphan who needs some love?\\n“I’m not romantic.” He gazes at me, determination on his face. “I won’ t\\nbe faithful. But I’ll be at your beck and call. You can push me around all\\nyou want. Don’ t you want to be the one on top now?”\\nA boy toy is what he’s proposing? Someone to use for affection  without\\nany romantic hassles. W ithout getting my heart invested.\\nIn exchange, all I have to do is pay him.\\n“You’re thinking about it, aren’ t you?” he croons.\\nBut I straighten,  never more disgusted. I know what perfect feels like. I\\ndon’t want anything less.\\n“I’m thinking you remind me of my father .” I grab a knife out of the\\nbutcher block. “People like you hurt the soul.”\\n“Tiernan de Haas—”\\n“I’m a V an der Ber g,” I growl, correcting him and launching the knife.\\nHe dives out of the way, shielding himself, and I pluck out two more\\nand throw those, as well, the guys stumbling into the living room.\\nI don’t waste time. I run back into the shop, keeping the lights  off and\\nthe bay doors open.\\n“Get her!” I hear Holcomb shout.\\nMy heart leaps into my throat, and I go to make a run for it, but think\\nbetter of it.\\nIf I can just get them out of the house…\\nSlipping behind the wardrobe in the shop I’d painted months ago, I\\nfreeze, tucking my arms in tight, so they don’ t see me.\\nFootfalls hit the small set of stairs, and I hear shuffling on the cement\\nfloor of the shop.\\n“She can’ t go far!” Holcomb shouts. “Get her the fuck back here!”\\nI see one of the guys dash outside, and I pull myself in tighter , afraid\\nhe’ll see me.\\nBut then he’s gone, and the lights in the shop turns on, the other two\\nmoving around.\\nWhat does he think he’s going to accomplish? I guess if he gets what he\\nwants then he wins. If not, I can’t prove he did any more than scare me. He\\nhasn’ t laid a hand on me yet.\\nI put my palm over my mouth to silence my breathing.\\n“Take the bikes,” Holcomb grits out. “They owe us.” “What about her?”\\n“I’m gonna fuck that bitch, just as soon as I send her crazy-ass\\nboyfriend to jail,” he fires back. “Dumb cunt is going on my wall.”\\nHis wall. The scoreboard Jake warned me about. Jesus…\\n“You sure there’ s not a warrant out for us?” the guy asks instead. “I saw\\nJake in town earlier , heading into the station with Kaleb and Noah.”\\n“They can’t prove that fire was us.” Tools shift, cabinets open, and\\nsomething slam s shut. “And if I can’t find the fucking keys again, I’m\\nburning down the stable this time, with the horses inside.”\\nMy hands go cold as realization hits me. Fire.\\nKeys.\\nJake was right. Someone starte d that fire in the barn. They couldn’ t\\nmake it out with the bikes they intended to steal that night, so they started a\\nfire, instead.\\n“This is getting out of hand,” the other guy tells him. “We almost died\\ntrying to get up here and back down last winter . What if that fire had\\nspread? They could’ve gotten killed.” His tone grows harder . “There’ s no\\nhelp up here if they needed it!”\\n“I know .” Terrance chuckles. “That’ s the beauty of it.”\\nI peer around the corner , seeing him searching the worktables and desk.\\nThe other guy faces away from me, but I see he has a dark buzz cut and\\nrings on his fingers.\\nTerrance spins around to look at him, and I dive back behind the\\narmoire, spotting  my bow on the tables behind me. Thunder cracks outside,\\nand I grab it, picking it up quietly .\\n“So what would you rather do?” Holcomb asks him. “Join the Army\\nlike your dad wants you to, or you wanna race? I’m getting us our bikes and\\na new sponsor , and I’m not leaving without them!”\\nI stick a few arrows into the back of my jeans and load another one into\\nthe bow .\\n“She’ s writing me a check, and then—maybe—I’ll leave,” he says.\\n“After I turn her inside out, but you don’t need to stick around for that\\npart.”\\nKaleb, wher e are you?\\nThe bowstring creaks, and I wince, waiting to see if they noticed the\\nsound.\\n“Or you can stick around for that part, too, but me first,” he adds. I blow out a silent breath, pinch  the arrow between my fingers,  and get\\nready .\\n“Here!” he bursts out, and I hear keys jingle. “See if that works.”\\nThe bikes fire to life, and I realize they found the keys to the finished\\nprojects Jake is about to ship off. I don’t know where the third guy is, and a\\ntrickle of sweat glides down my back.\\nJust leave. T ake the bikes and go. Please.\\nJust leave.\\n“We won’ t get away with this,” the other man says.\\n“We will,” T errance retorts. “They were lost in the fire.”\\n“What fire?”\\nI hear laughing, and I pause, letting his plan sink in.\\nHolcomb is going to threaten me when he finds me. I know Kale b won’ t\\nget into any serious trouble for some damage to their property , so his\\nattempt at blackmail failed.\\nSo Plan B is, if I don’t comply , write him a check, and give him\\nwhatever else he wants from me. He’s going to take everything. He’s going\\nto set another fire.\\nAnd he has two witnesses with him who will vouch he was anywhere\\nelse but here tonight. They’ll make off with the bikes, and the fire\\ndepartment will never get here in time.\\nI swallow down the bile.\\nJake, Kaleb, and Noah built this place. This is Kaleb’ s home. The only\\nplace he feels good outside of the fishing cabin.\\nI almost  stop and reach into my pocket for my phone again. I could call\\nthe police.\\nBut by the time I tried to alert them, T errance Holcomb would be on me.\\nAnd by the time they traced the call, he’d be done.\\nShooting out from behind the armoire, I pull the bow string, drawing\\nback my arrow , and shoot quick and sure, grazing the other guy’ s shoulder .\\nHe flies back, falling to the ground as the arrow stabs the wall behind\\nhim, and T errance darts away , out of the area, stunned.\\nI round them, making my way for the steps of the house again and load\\nanother arrow , aiming for Holcomb and shooting fast.\\nI just want them to run. Just go!\\nHe flies out of the way, crashing to the ground and shattering my end\\ntable into pieces in the process. They scramble to their feet, the other guy staring at me wide-eyed like\\nhe suddenly realizes he made a mistake.\\nBut they don’ t run. Holcomb char ges for me, and I scream.\\nFuck!\\nI dart inside the house and lock the door, racing through the living room\\nand up the stairs. I’ll lock myself in my room, call the police, and if I have\\nto, I’ll escape off the balcony . I wanted to stop him from burnin g down the\\nplace, but not at the risk of him hurting me.\\nHe’s fucking insane.\\nI stumble on the stairs, my shin slamming against a step. I cry out, but\\nthen a couple of pounds hit the door downstairs, and I hear wood splinter as\\nit flies open, hitting the refrigerator .\\nI stop breathing.\\nClimbing to my feet, I dig in my heels and run to the second floor ,\\nhearing footfalls on the stairs behind me. I bypass my door and keep going,\\ntearing up Kaleb’ s stairs and swinging the door closed behin d me, locking\\nit. I back away from the door, pulling out another arrow , but I trip over my\\nshoe and fall to the ground, catching myself on my hands.\\nScurrying farthe r away , I nock the arrow , hearing his steps ascend the\\nstairs, and I pull back the bowstring as he kicks open the door .\\nI fire.\\nHis shou lder jerks backward, and I hop to my feet, plucking the last\\narrow out of my jeans.\\nBut before I can fit it, I watch as he stumbles, sways, and falls to his\\nknees, the arrow pierced through his right shoulder .\\nI exhale, my lungs and stomach screaming.\\nMore sounds hit the stairs, and I draw back the last arrow , seeing his\\nfriend fill the doorway .\\nHis worried, dark eyes fall from me to Holcomb lying on the floor .\\nI point the arrow at him, and he straightens, holding out his hands in\\ndefense.\\n“The Army sounding like a better idea yet?” I growl.\\nHe nods, and I jerk my chin, telling him to beat it.\\nHe casts one more look at his friend and then bolts, his footsteps\\ndisappearing down the stairs.\\nTerrance grunts, his face twisted in pain as he tries to rise, and I see his\\nsweatshirt soaked with blood. I shoot out my foot, kicking him to the ground. He lands on the end of\\nthe arrow sticking out of his back and howls as I point my last one at him.\\nI need to call the cops, but I’m not taking my weapon of f him yet.\\n“Fuck,” he cries, gritting his teeth.\\nHe rolls onto his hands and knee s and then climbs to his feet. I scramble\\nback, about to shoot him again,  but he stumbles out of the room  and leans\\ninto the wall, descending the staircase. I don’t fucking care if he gets away ,\\nas long as he leaves.\\nI follow him, watching as he hits the floor again, crawling for the\\nstaircase. His hands give out underneath him, and he falls, sliding down the\\nstairs and screaming at the arrow in his shoulder .\\n“Tiernan!” Noah calls from the living room. “T iernan, answer me now!”\\n“Here!” I call.\\nHolcomb spills down the rest of the stairs, and I hold the bow and\\narrow , seeing Kaleb rush for me, taking my face in his hands.\\nNoah takes the weapon from me, and I hear the front door swing open\\nagain.\\n“Jesus Christ,” Jake snaps, taking in the scene.\\n“Stay down,” Noah orders Holcomb, planting his boot on his back and\\npushing him to the floor . “Or I’ll show you how we handle an injury like\\nthat up here without an ambulance.”\\nKaleb stares into my eyes, breat hing a mile a minute before jerking me\\nin and pressing his lips hard to my forehead.\\n“Are you okay?” Jake asks, rushing up to us.\\nI nod, my heart still hammering. “I’m fine.”\\nI think. I don’ t know , everything hurts, but I can’ t tell what exactly .\\nI pull away , looking at Jake glance between Holcomb and me. “Tiernan,\\nI’m sorry ,” he says. “Y ou’re okay? Really?”\\n“Fine.”\\n“I didn’t think.” His hand goes to his head. “We shouldn’ t have  left you\\nalone.”\\n“You heard the call?” I ask.\\n“Yeah.” He smiles weakly . “We sped here the whole way .”\\nI knew they’d come.\\n“You’re sure you’re fine? He didn’ t…try anything?”\\n“He tried a lot.” I don’t know if I want to laugh at how mise rably he\\nfailed or cry at how relieved I am. “I’m perfectly fine, though.” Holcomb groans  on the floor , and Jake shoots him a scowl, taking out\\nhis phone as he walks away . “I’m calling Benson.”\\nThe sherif f. And since they visited him once tonight, and Kaleb is still\\nhere, then I guess no one’ s pressing char ges like T errance threatened.\\n“Hey , you didn’ t miss, at least?” Noah tries to joke.\\nI feign a laugh. “It was at close-range.”\\nHe smiles. Then he presses his foot down harder , grinding his boot into\\nHolcomb’ s back. “Motherfucker ,” he taunts. “Y ou just made my day .”\\nYeah. Kaleb might be in the clear , but Holcomb just took his place with\\nthe sherif f.\\nI look up at Kaleb.\\nBut he’ s not looking at me anymore.\\nHe stand s a few feet away , looking over at my suitcase by the door. His\\neyes turn to me, suddenly hard.\\nI swallow through the tightness in my throat.\\n“Were there others?” Jake asks as he comes back in the room.\\nIt takes a moment to tear my eyes away from Kaleb.\\nFinally , I nod. “There were. They scattered. I didn’ t recognize  them. I\\ncan describe one of them, though.”\\nKaleb walks outside with his father to check the property , and I sit down\\non the stairs with Noah, resting my head in my hands for minutes and\\nminutes to try to calm down.\\nAfter a while, the sherif f arrives, the ambulance not far behind, and they\\nload up Holcom b on the stretch er while Benson takes my statement. I tell\\nthem about the fire last winter and Holcomb’ s confession when he didn’ t\\nknow I was listening, and he tells us they passed his car on the road on the\\nway up here. They guess he parked off somewhere quiet, so he could come\\nonto the property undetected.\\nKaleb and Jake come back in, Kaleb staring at me the whole time from\\nacross the room like he’s scared and sorry , but his distance is scarier . Why\\nwon’ t he come over to me?\\nHe’s so far away all of a sudden. Every once in a while, his eyes go to\\nmy suitcase.\\nThe cops and ambulance finally leave, and Noah heads outside to secure\\nthe stable and check the animals, while Jake stands on the porch, finishing\\nup with Benson. I walk into the kitchen, seeing Kaleb sitting in the dark at the table. His\\nelbows rest on his knees as he leans forward, bows his head, and locks his\\nhands together .\\nHe raises his eyes, looking at me.\\nReality comes crashing back in.\\nI don’t know what I expected, I guess. Obviously , I didn’ t ask for\\nHolcomb to show up here, but maybe when Kaleb rushed in, took my face\\nin his hands, and saw what could’ve happened, he’d realize that he wanted a\\nlife with me.\\nThat he wanted to live instead of hiding inside himself.\\nInstead, he saw my suitcase and shut down, because he thinks I’m like\\nhis mother , and that I’m abandoning him. He’s being betrayed, but what he\\ndoesn’ t realize is it’s not aban donment when you’re an adult. It’s called\\nleaving, and he has it in his power to stop me.\\nTonight could’ve gone so much worse. Doesn’ t he realize that?\\n“The baby isn’t his,” Noah whispers behind me. “Dad was able to\\nsqueeze the doctor for info. Cici got pregnant last August. Kaleb was at the\\nfishing cabin the entire month. He didn’ t show up until the beginning of\\nSeptember .”\\nThat first night we met.\\n“Holcomb?” I guess.\\n“That’ s what we’re thinking, too.”\\nHolcomb is the father . He and Cici were together at the bar on my\\nbirthday . She was fucking with us today .\\nI stare at Kaleb, a horrible feeling falling over me instead of relief,\\nthough. He’s not going to fight  for me. He won’ t write to me. He won’ t\\nsign.\\nHe’ll never talk to me.\\nHe’ll never communicate with his children if he has any .\\nHe loves everyone in this house, but he won’ t even tell us.\\nSomething crushes my chest, and tears pool as I gaze at him.\\n“Tiernan!” a woman yells outside. “Oh, my God!”\\nI blink.\\n“Is Tiernan here?” I hear Mirai’ s voice as she pummels up the steps on\\nthe porch.\\nJake says something I can’t hear and then she shouts, “Get out of my\\nway!” Mirai?\\nTears stream down my face, and I spin around, seeing her run into the\\nhouse, lock eyes with me, and drop her handbag, rushing over .\\nShe wraps her arms around me, and I pause a moment and then… I\\ncrush her to me, holding her so tightly she probably can’ t breathe.\\nI hold back the sobs, but I can’t hide the tears. I didn’ t realize I’d missed\\nher until now . I squeeze her so hard, everything hitting me at once.\\n“What the hell happened?” she asks.\\nI release her , drying my eyes. “It’ s okay . I’m fine.”\\n“You’re not fine,” she shouts, and I can see Jake walking back into the\\nhouse behind her . “You’re bleeding!”\\nShe turns my face to inspect my cheek, and I touch it, pulling my hand\\naway to see a little blood. I must’ve scraped it somewhere in all the\\nrunning.\\nI hug her again,  her long, dark hair soft like designer shampoo can do\\nand smelling like a spa. Memories wash over me.\\nI pull away to look at her. She looks like I used to. I’d forgotten how\\nmanicured I once was. Her nails, her make-up, her hair…\\n“How did you get here?” I ask. “I thought I was picking you up at the\\nairport.”\\n“I got an earlier connection and rented a car,” she explains, still\\ninspecting my body to make sure I’m okay . “I had a weird feelin g you were\\ngoing to try to keep me from here or something.”\\nVery astute, actually .\\nI look around, seeing Noah and Jake staring, Kaleb still silent in the\\nkitchen.\\n“Let’ s go back outside,” I tell her .\\n“Tiernan…” Jake says as I pass, but I ignore him.\\nI grab my jacket, Mirai’ s handb ag, and hand it to her as I take her back\\nout to her car, which still sits running with the headlights on. She must’ve\\nbolted from it when she saw Benson’ s cop car. She might’ve even passed\\nthe ambulance on her way up here, too.\\n“Is that him?” She looks behind  us as I take her back down the steps.\\n“Your uncle?”\\n“Just come on.” I slip on my jacket.\\nI should introduce her . We should all sit down and talk. But I can’t do this. I need to get my head straight before I decide what\\nshe need s to know and doesn’ t, and too much has happened  in the last\\ntwelve hours, I haven’ t even processed it myself. I need to send her off, deal\\nwith Kaleb, and then deal with her .\\n“I need you to go to a motel in town,” I tell her, stopping at the car. “I’ll\\ncome to you in a bit. I’ll meet you there.”\\n“What?” she blurts out. “No!”\\n“Please?” I plead, gazing into her brown eyes with those warm flecks of\\namber . “I need to do something here. Please. Don’ t worry .”\\n“Tiernan,” she starts.\\nBut someone approaches, and I look over, seeing Kaleb open the car’s\\nback door , set my suitcase inside, and close it again.\\nI freeze.\\nI watch as he moves to the passenger ’s side front door and open it for\\nme, meeting my eyes.\\nAnd suddenly , Mirai isn’t here. Jake and Noah aren’ t watching from the\\nporch, and I can’ t feel the rain that’ s turned lighter now , hitting my head.\\nHe’s helping me leave.\\nHe’s telling me to leave.\\nI stare at him, my eyes burning, but I’m too shocked to cry. He’s\\ndrawing a line. The line I was afraid to draw earlier when I pack ed. I didn’ t\\nwant to leave.\\nI just thought I’d give us some space.\\nOr maybe I hoped he’d find me gone and come after me.\\nHe’s telling me to go, though. He would rather me leave than ever have\\nto say anything to me.\\nI hold his beaut iful green eyes, seeing the emotion behind that he tries\\nto hide, but as I try to search for what to say to solve this—to save us—\\nthere are no words left.\\nMaybe words were never really the problem. Actions speak louder ,\\ndon’t they say?\\nAnd his are loud and clear .\\nI climb into the car, as if on auto-pilot, quickly closing the door, my\\ninsides knotting and twisting, because the idea of leaving isn’t real. This\\ncan’t be happening.\\nThis isn’ t happening.\\n“Kaleb,” I hear Noah bark. Mirai rounds the car, hopping into the driver ’s side and putting  the car\\nin reverse.\\n“Tiernan!” Jake bellows, and I see him pounding down the steps out of\\nthe corner of my eye.\\n“No!” Noah yells.\\nJake slams his hand on the hood of the car, staring at us through the\\nwindshield. “Stop!”\\n“Just go,” I tell her, turning my head away so Kaleb can’t see the tears.\\n“Please…. please just go.”\\nShe locks the doors, slams on the gas, and I bury my face in my hands\\nuntil we’re deep, down the dark highway , away from the house , and I can’t\\nsee his face again.  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nI move my spoo n through the soup, listening to the quiet. God, this house is\\nlike a tomb. I always knew that, but damn.\\nRight now , the boys would be watching TV , Noah laughing loudly while\\nJake yelled at him from the kitchen about his damn dishes.\\nThere would be music.\\nJoking and playing.\\nLife.\\nThere would be Kaleb.\\nMy chin trembles. It’ s been twenty-two hours since I’ve seen him.\\nEverything feels foreign now. I look around my parents’ white kitchen,\\npristine marble counter tops, and chrome appliances. This isn’ t my home.\\nMirai pushes a leather binder across the island to me. I glance at it.\\n“They left you everything, of course,” she says. “This is for your\\nrecords.”\\nMy parents’ will stares back at me, and I look away , back to my soup.\\nGod, I don’t care. My heart has been ripped out, and it’s still laying in\\ntheir driveway in Chapel Peak.\\nI blink away the tears. I need to stop trying to understand how he could\\nlet me go. It’ s nothing I’m not used to.\\nAt least my parents left me the money . At least I was a mentio n in the\\nwill. Proof that they cared enough to make sure I’d be okay .\\nI was always sure of a life of comfort with them, if nothing else. I’m so\\nrich, I’ll never have to lift a finger in the world or even leave this house if I don’t want to.\\nSix months ago, I might’ve been grateful for that.\\n“Don’ t stay here,” she begs. “Stay with me. Or rent an apartment? You\\nneed people around you.”\\nI sit up, pushing  the bowl away from me. “You know me by now,” I tell\\nher. “I may have the personality of a brick, but…I don’ t need anyone.”\\nI’m kidding. I need the candy-making people and… the Netflix people.\\n“It’s not a weakness to need anyone,” Mirai says, watching me. “Except\\nthose pricks. If I knew what they were going to do, I wouldn’ t have let you\\nget on that plane. T wice.”\\n“Stop.” I shake my head at her, tired all of a sudden. “That’ s not what\\nhappened, and I’m not a child. I haven’ t been one for a long time.”\\nShe looks away , her lips tight, but she stays quiet.\\nI told her everything on the car ride to the airport last night. She was\\nlivid, almost running us off the road, and she nearly turned us around to go\\nback to the house so she could deal with my uncle. I had to beg her to\\nreconsider . I cried the whole plane ride to L.A.\\nI didn’t mean to spill everything, but I needed perspective. I needed a\\nnew friend, I guess.\\n“They’re my family ,” I say, my voice gentle. “We were forced together\\nand shit happened.”\\nI was there. Not her .\\nMy only wrong-step was falling in love with one of them.\\nShe looks like she wants to say more, but eventually , she nods, letting it\\ngo for now. “Carter is walking the grounds,” she says, slipping her heels\\nback on. “I’ll be back later with some clothes.”\\n“I’m fine,” I assure her .\\nSecurity is here. I don’ t need a sleepover .\\nBut she looks at me level. “Just let me care about you, okay?”\\nSomething in her voice shuts me up, like she’s done being nice and\\ndone asking.\\nKind of like Jake. I give her a small smile.\\nShe hugs me, and I close my eyes, squeezing my arms around her .\\nShe says goodbye and leaves, and I prop up my elbows on the counter ,\\nstaring at the will.\\nBut the silver case to my left out of the corner of my eye is all I can\\nreally see. I look over at the urn that looks like a large jewelry box, sterling silver\\nwith ornate etchings. Mirai has been keeping it until she brought it to me\\ntonight. Just one urn for them both.\\nMy parents wanted to be buried at the tree with the swing in the yard,\\nclearly never questioning that I would stay here or ever sell this house.\\nI bury my face in my hands,  letting out a groan. This ache, like\\nsomething is burrowing into my stomach, and I know my eyes are puffy,\\neven if I haven’ t looked in a mirror since yesterday morning when I\\nenvisioned myself pregnant with Kaleb’ s baby .\\nGod, yesterday morning. How can so much have changed in one day?\\nSliding off the stool, I stick my hands in the pocket of my hoodie and\\ndrift around the house, taking in how much has changed. Everything is still\\nin its place, nothing really dif ferent. Except for the way I’m seeing it.\\nThe fireplace was for show , only turned on for parties or holiday\\npictures, and it runs on gas. No need for firewood, no crackles of the logs or\\nsmell of burning bark.\\nEvery few years, rooms were redecorated, furniture that had barely been\\nused replaced with a new style. At no time did I ever veg out on the couch\\nto watch TV or make popcorn for a movie night.\\nThe boys would tear this place up in no time. I shake my head, picturing\\na deer head over the mantel.\\nI drift upstairs and stop at the top of the landing, ready to veer left for\\nmy room, but I pause, staring right. My parents’ bedroom door sits closed,\\nand I head over , gripping the handle.\\nThe cool brass seeps down to my bones, and I can still hear her voice\\nbehind the door. The glass she’s drinking from clanking against the marble\\ntops of the table s inside and the pills in my father ’s bottle jiggling as he\\ntries to gear up for his stressful days.\\nI should’ve talked.\\nScreamed, yelled, cried…\\nI should’ve asked.\\nI release the handle, leaving the door closed, and walk for my room and\\nopen the door. As soon as I step inside, however , something fills up in my\\nlungs, and I don’t know what it is, but a small laugh escapes as the tears\\nstream at the same time.\\nThe ominous Virginia Woolf posters and photographs of myself in\\nthoughtful poses staring of f into the wind. Jesus.\\nMy parents always kept recent photographs of me for reference during\\ninterviews, but the decorator thought putting some in my room wasn’ t weird\\nat all.\\nAnd gray . Gray everywhere.\\nGray fur coverlet. Gray walls. Gray carpet. It’s like Pleasantville. I’m\\nalmost scared to look in the mirror .\\nI stand there, no desire to move farther . This was never my room.\\nSpinning around , I head down the stairs and back into the kitchen, not\\nsure what the hell I’m doing, but I know it’s something. I grab a tea light\\nand a lighter out of the drawer and tuck my parents’ urn under my arm as I\\nhead through the house and into the garage. Digging through some drawers\\nI finally find a garden shovel and grab it.\\nJust do it. I couldn’ t stand up at their funeral and show them, myself, or\\nanyone else that my soul wasn’ t fucking crippled, but I can get this done for\\nthem.\\nHurrying outsid e, I circle the house and head to the tree, the tire swing\\nthat Mirai cut down and left laying on the ground now gone.\\nI drop to my knees, light the candle and set it in the grass, giving me\\njust enough light.\\nI start digging. Stabbing the grass, I work out a patch and keep slicing\\nthrough the soil, making the hole wider and deeper . My belly churns, the\\nbox sitting there like a fucking bomb about to go off. I can’t believe they’re\\nashes.\\nFucking ashes. They were so much before. Lar ge. So important.\\nAnd now…they fit in a shoe box.\\nA fucking shoe box.\\nA sob escapes, but I swallow the rest down and toss the shovel away .\\nGod.\\nSlowly , I open up the box and—very gently—remove the clear plastic\\nbag.\\nIt’s the weight of a truck, even though it’ s barely the weight of an infant.\\nI carefully spread the ashes in the hole, stuf f the empty bag back into the\\nbox, and push the dirt over top, covering the hole again.\\nI choke on the tears and brush off my hands, collapsing to the ground\\nand sitting with my back up to the tree. It’s that easy, isn’t it? It’s so easy to bury them—to throw things  away—\\nbut it doesn’ t mean that they aren’ t still felt. That what they did disappears,\\ntoo, because it doesn’ t.\\nI wish they’d had gotten to know me.\\nI wish they didn’t have to die for me to be given the opport unity to\\nknow myself.\\nSometimes the clouds aren’ t enough, I guess. We need the whole damn\\nstorm.\\nI stay out there for a long time, looking up at the thick bough above\\nfrom where my father tied the rope for the swing. The wear in the bark\\nshows years of all the nights they played. It’s still surreal to me that I never\\nonce came out here to sit on the swing.\\nBut then, there was no one to push me.\\nI blow out the candle and take everything back inside, putting it away\\nand closing the house up. I turn off the lights, making sure the back door is\\nlocked but not bolting the front, because Mirai is coming back.\\nClimbing the stairs, I yawn, excruciatingly tired. It’s after seven here, so\\nit’s only after eight in Chapel Peak. What’ s he doing right now? He\\nwouldn’ t be going to bed yet. Not unless I was, and then he goes where I\\ngo.\\nMy heart aches. I don’t think I expected him to call, but I wasn’ t sure I\\nexpected that he’d just accept us being apart, either . But here we are, a day\\nlater, and nothing.\\nI stop at the top of the stairs, about to head to bed, but I step right\\ninstead and walk to my parents’ door , opening it up this time.\\nThe smell of vanilla and bergamot assault me, and I almost hold my\\nbreath on reflex. I like the scents, just not together . It will always remind me\\nof her .\\nEntering the room, I look around and notice everything is as pristine as\\nif they were still alive. The bed is made, no sign that their bodie s laid there\\nfor hours all those months ago, and the glass top of my mother ’s make-up\\ntable glimmers in the moonlight streaming through the sheer white curtains.\\nThe crystals dangling from her lamp gleam, and I flip on a light, doing a\\nthree-sixty around the lar ge bedroom.\\nAs much as I try to search for a connection to them, though, it doesn’ t\\ncome. There are no memories here. No nights of crawling into their bed. No\\nplaying with my mother ’s make-up or helping my dad with his tie. I walk into the closet and turn on the light, gazing at the long line of\\nbeautiful dresses I desperately wanted to try on over the years and never\\ncould.\\n“Hey ,” I hear Mirai say behind me.\\nShe’s back.\\nI turn my head slowly , looking at the closet of clothes and the displays\\nof jewelry and watches. I think of all the art in the house and the cars in the\\ngarage that have  nothing to do with me anymore. A home full of things that\\nwere never a part of me, and I no longer desire them to be.\\n“Can you call Christie’ s in the morning?” I ask Mirai, pulling the closet\\ndoor closed and twisting around  to look at her. “Let’ s hold an auction. We’ll\\ndonate the proceeds to their favorite charities.”\\n“Are you—”\\n“Yes,” I cut her of f, walking out the door . “I’m sure.”\\n \\n \\n“Thank you.” I smile, taking the breakfast burrito and my receipt.\\nWalking out of the small shop, I pull up the hood of my sweatshirt,\\nprotecting my AirPods from the light rain as “The Hand That Feeds”  plays\\nin my ears. I cross the empty walkway , bypassing the pier, and head out to\\nthe beach, sand spilling inside my V ans as my heels dig in.\\nThe dark clouds hang low as the waves roll in, the morning sun hiding\\nand the beach blissfully empty  except for a couple joggers. Two surfers\\npaddle out, their black wetsuits glistening. I plop down and shimmy out of\\nmy backpack, taking out my water bottle and sitting cross-legged as I\\nunwrap the foil around my burrito.\\nI take a bite and stare out at the ocean, the salt and sea in the air making\\nme smile a little.\\nSix weeks.\\nSix weeks back in California, and the days are getting easier. The\\nauction will be happening soon, I’ve redecorated my bedroom and\\nrevamped some  of the furnitur e in the house, and I’ve chosen a design\\nschool in Seattle to attend colleg e in the fall. I have a few months to travel\\nor do just about anything I want to do before school starts.\\nI’ve called Jake. He’ s called me. But he’s not much of a talker on the phone, adamant that I just need to\\ncome home and he’ll talk to me there when I do.\\nI’m not going home, though. I need to do this.\\nI finish my burrito and stuff my trash into my backpack, lifting my\\nwater bottle to my mouth. I might not be any happier than I was when I left,\\nbut I respect myself, at least. There’ s no other choice.\\nI lie back, fallin g onto the sand, ready to feel the small drops on my\\nface.\\nBut as I look up, someone stands over me, looking down.\\n“Hey ,” he says.\\nNoah?\\nI yank out my AirPods and shoot up, pushing my hood of f my head.\\n“So this is Surf City, huh?” he says, dropping his boots to the ground\\nand plopping down on the sand next to me.\\nI gape at him, unable to blink. “Wha—where did you come from?”\\nHe smiles that Noah smile, and I can’t control myself. Tears shake my\\nchest, and I dive in, wrapping my arms around his neck.\\n“How did you know I was here?” I ask.\\n“Well, you were n’t home,” he tells me, his arms tight around me. “And\\nit was raining, so I took a chance.”\\nI let out a laugh, remembering I’d told him about me loving to come to\\nHuntington Beach when it rains. Clever .\\n“Actually…” He lets me go, and I sit back to take in his new haircut and\\nsun-kissed face. “My dad snuck a tracking app onto your phone when you\\nweren’ t looking after the Holcomb incident at the lake last August.”\\nIs that so? I roll my eyes.\\nHolcomb.\\nI hadn’ t thought about him in a while. He pleaded guilty , Jake told me,\\nand got fifteen months for arson, along with a few other char ges.\\n“So, when did you get in?”\\nHe thinks for a moment. “Six weeks ago?”\\n“Six weeks?” I blurt out. “You’ve been in L.A. for six week s? Why\\ndidn’ t you come to the house?”\\nHe’s been here as long as I have. I haven’ t been able to get ahold of him\\nother than texts. Did he intend for it to be a surprise? Because, if so, it took\\nhim long enough.\\nSix weeks… His tone softens, and he looks thoughtful. “I kind of needed to be alone,\\ntoo.”\\nI stare at him, but I’ve got nothing to say . I get it. Shit happened.\\nThe wind blows my hair, and I push it off my forehead as the rain\\nslowly wets it. “It’ s so good to see you,” I tell him.\\n“I hoped it would be.”\\nDoes he have a place, then? He hasn’ t been staying in hotels this whole\\ntime, has he?\\nEither way, I hope this means I’ll see him more now. At least until I\\nleave for school.\\n“I’ve got a sponsor ,” he chirps.\\n“That’ s great.” I smile wide. “So, you have a team now .”\\n“He’ s building one, yes.” He nods. “I’m the lucky first recruit.”\\n“He?”\\n“Jared Trent of JT Racing,” he tells me. “He’ s an interesting guy. Kind\\nof like a cross between my father and Kaleb.”\\nThe mention of Kaleb gives me pause. Like I’d been pretending none of\\nit was real, and here comes Noah to kick me in the stomach.  Everything\\nsuddenly hurts.\\nBut I force a laugh. “Y ikes,” I say .\\n“I know .” His lips twist up, kind of forlorn. “He doesn’ t talk much, and\\nthen when he does, you kind of wished he hadn’ t.”\\nYeah. Kaleb and Jake are like that.\\n“But…he likes what I can do,” Noah continues. “That’ s who I need in\\nmy corner .”\\nI’m glad he found what he was looking for. I hate that he thinks he\\nnever had that already , though.\\n“You have so many in your corner .” I gaze at him. “Just wait.”\\nI wrap my arms around his arm and lay my head down on his shoulder ,\\nboth of us watching the waves roll in. I’ll be at every race I can, and I’m\\ngoing to brag about him to all my friends.\\nAs soon as I make some.\\n“You can ask me about him, you know?” he says in a low voice.\\nI drop my eyes, not saying anything. I’m desperate to hear anything\\nabout Kaleb.\\nAnd not. He’s obviously alive, so he’s eating, sleeping, and breathing\\njust fine without me, even though some days I feel like my insides are on the outside.\\n“Dad says he left for the fishing  cabin after you left, and he’s been gone\\never since.”\\nI shake my head. “Let’ s not talk about him.” I look up, meeting Noah’ s\\neyes. “What about you? Are you happy?”\\nHe looks down at me, and I wonder why it couldn’ t be him.\\nHe’s so easy to love.\\n“Do you resent me?” I whisper when he doesn’ t answer .\\nHe hood s his eyes, a gentle smile curling his lips. “You were right,\\nTiernan,” he says. “I was in love but with something else.”\\nRacing.\\n“I have my future now ,” he tells me. “I’m really happy .”\\nI lay my head down again, letting out a breath I didn’ t realize I’d been\\nholding for months.\\nLaying his head over mine, he kisses my hair and we watch the ocean.\\n“He loves you to death, you know?” he says.\\nNeedles prick my throat as a tear spills down my cheek. “He’ s still in\\nthat car , Noah.”  \\n \\n \\nT i e r n a n\\n \\nNoah heads back to the extend ed-stay hotel he’s paying through the nose\\nfor to gather his things, while I return to the house to prepare a room for\\nhim. His sponso r is based somew here outside of Chicago, so Noah might be\\ntraveling a lot, but they also have a branch of their business here, so this\\nwill be home-base when he’ s in town.\\nWe spent the rest of the day walking and talking, and after lunch, I took\\nhim to one of my father ’s favorite tailors to get him suited for any dressy\\noccasions that might pop up in the future with his new adventure. By the\\ntime we were done, it was late. We ate dinner , he went back to his place to\\nsleep and pack up his things to check out tomorrow , and I came home.\\nI’ve had the bed replaced in my parents’ old room, so I’ll put him in\\nthere, since it has a private bathroom. I don’t need to take the chance of\\nrunning into an overnight guest, should he choose to have one.\\n“You should be shot!” I hear Mirai scream as I enter the house.\\nI stop, pausing before gently closing the door as I listen. What the hell?\\n“Whoever designed this room should be shot,” Jake spits back. “These\\ndrapes look like the same shit that lines caskets.”\\nJake? My heart lifts a little more. He’ s here, too.\\n“Ugh!” she growls.\\nSomething crash es, shattering across the floor , and I tiptoe through the\\nfoyer and hide behind the wall to the sitting room.\\n“Whoops!” Jake says. “There goes a candy dish. Probably three-\\nhundred dollars and never used, either , because this house hasn’t seen a carb since 2002.”\\nI snort, but I cover my mouth, so they don’ t know I’m here.\\n“Leave,” she says.\\n“No.”\\n“I’ll call the police!”\\n“TMZ will be here before they are.”\\nI shake my head, peering around the corner to see him digging his hand\\ninto a bag of my veggie fries as Mirai stands close, hands on her hips and\\nhuffing.\\nShe holds up her claws like she wants to strangle him. “I’ve never\\nwanted to hit someone so much since—”\\n“Since last night when you dreamed about me?”\\nI pull back and lean against the wall. Mirai’ s anger over what went\\ndown on the mountain between  the Van der Bergs and me is still strong—\\nbut man, he’ s not afraid of it.\\n“Where is she?” he asks.\\n“I don’ t know .”\\n“Mirai?” he sing-songs.\\n“Screw you.”\\nI peek around the corner again, seeing their backs to me, him standing\\nbehind her and egging her on.\\n“It didn’ t happen like you think it happened,” he explains. “We’re her\\nhome. W e’d kill to protect her .”\\nMy cheeks warm at hearing that, but Mirai still isn’ t having it.\\n“Fuck of f,” she says.\\nI jaunt past the archway and dash up the stairs before they can see me,\\nnot having the energy to get in the middle of that tonight. I’ll say hi to Jake\\ntomorrow .\\n“I’m calling security ,” I hear her warn him.\\n“I’m not leaving,” he taunts. “I’ll be here all night if I have to. Waiting\\nwith you...”\\n“Nope, you won’ t.”\\n“Close to you…” he continues.\\n“Shut. Up.”\\n“Watching you…”\\n“Ew.”\\n“Just you and me…” he teases. There’ s a pause and then, “Ow!” Jake bellows. “That hurt! My nose is\\nbleeding. Jesus!”\\n“Not on the carpet!” she cries.\\nI speed walk to my room, grab the handle, and quietly close the door .\\nI’m not sure if Noah found me, because he knew his father was coming,\\nor if Jake came to see how Noah was doing and decided to make a stop\\nhere, but either way, I’m happy  they’re both here. I just hope Jake made\\nprovisions for someone to stay on the property back home and take care of\\nthe animals in his absence if Kaleb is still no where to be seen.\\nI’ll leave him and Mirai alone for now, though. They need to spend\\nsome time together and sort their shit out. Whether or not she approves of\\nwhat happened, he’s not going anywhere. If she wants to keep being here\\nfor me, she’ll have to deal with him.\\nI crash to my bed, burying my face in my pillow . It was a good day but\\nlong. The ever-present flutter that left my heart when I left the peak six\\nweeks ago is back to some extent. They’re here, and I feel more like I’m\\nhome. A little more, anyway .\\nMy course catalog for school looms like an elephant on my nightstand,\\nbut I feel good, and looking at that makes me feel less good. I wanted to go\\nto college this morning.\\nBut now that they’re here…\\nGoddamn them.  Always confusin’ me. Reaching up, I pull the chain of\\nmy lamp and close my eyes as the room goes dark.\\n \\n \\nI startle awake, something stirri ng me. I blink the sleep away and flip over\\nonto my back, waiting for the room to come into view .\\nWhat was that? It was like hail. It doesn’ t hail in L.A.\\nI turn on the lamp and sit up, rubbing my eyes. I look at the window , the\\nblack night clear and quiet beyond it.\\nRising from the bed, I walk over and pull aside the sheer curtain.\\nI cover my yawn with my hand, taking in the blue hue of the grass and\\nthe shadow of the tree falling over the dark lawn.\\nBut then the shadow moves, and I look closer .\\nA rope hangs from the same bough my parents used, and a small tire is\\nsecured to the end of it. My pulse quickens. Am I seeing that right? Mirai cut down the tire last August, and the rope was gone when I came home.\\nI…\\nI charge for my bedroom door and open it, jogging down the hallway .\\nLaughter comes  from the kitche n, and the scent of Jake’ s chili wafts over\\nme, making my stomach growl , but I ignore it and slip down the hallway\\nand out the back door .\\nWhen was the last time I looked out that window? Yesterday , maybe?\\nDid Mirai have it hung? One for me this time?\\nI guess it would be thoughtful.\\nOr maybe she hung it for my parents, since she knows I buried the ashes\\nthere. Kind of a final memorial of sorts.\\nI round the back of the house and see it ahead, swaying in the soft\\nbreeze.\\nIt’s not the same tire. This one is a little smaller with a white stripe\\naround it. Something maybe a child could fit inside.\\nSomeone steps out from around the tree, and I stop, meeting his eyes.\\nKaleb looks at me.\\nEverything insid e my lungs empties, and I don’t feel like this is real, but\\nhe moves, placing his hand on the rope above the tire, holding it out for me.\\nHe did this?\\nWhen…? How…?\\nI inch closer to him, my feet carrying me without a thought. “What are\\nyou doing here?”\\nMy voice is barely audible, because my mouth is suddenly dry, and I\\ncan’t believe Kaleb is anywhere outside Chapel Peak. He flew here?\\nOr maybe he drove, but either way…\\nIt’s surreal. I can’ t picture him anywhere else but there, but here he is.\\n“How did you get here?” I ask him.\\nHe doesn’ t reply , of course, simply holding out his hand for me to take.\\nI look down at the vein over the back of his palm, remembe ring the\\nnights I traced every inch of his body , that night, in particular .\\nI take his hand, and instead of guiding me inside the tire, he picks me up\\nunder the arms instead, lifting me high. I swing my legs around the rope,\\ngrabbing hold of it as he plants my ass on top.\\nI feel so high and happy , I almost feel sick. God, I love him.\\nHe’s here. I can touch him.\\nWhat does this mean? The bough creaks under my weight, and my stomach swoops, sitting up\\nhere. I always envisioned what  this would be like. I want to smile, but I\\ndon’t.\\nDrawing me back, he lets me go, swinging through the breeze, and I\\ncan’t hold it in anymore. I smile, despite myself, closing my eyes and\\nfeeling my body fly through the air. I come back, and he pushes me again,\\nthis time harder . I clutch the rope, holding it tight to my body , and revel in\\nthe lightness in my head and the spin in my stomach.\\nHe grabs the tire and twists it around, sending it and me twirling\\nthrough the night as it flies away , drifting toward the house and then back to\\nhim. I laugh and smile, finally stretching my arms long and tipping my head\\nback as the air sweeps through my hair .\\nIt’s beautiful and wonderful, and I feel free. No wonder she loved it out\\nhere.\\nIt’s almost enough to make me forget how hurt I was. I don’t want him\\nto leave.\\nBut I’m not sure he should’ve come.\\nThe tire spins, slowing down as Kaleb stops pushing me and lets me\\ncome to rest. My stomach settles again, and the world stops turning. I stare\\ndown at the ground as he stops the tire, standing behind me.\\n“How did you know about the tire swing?” I ask, but I don’t expect an\\nanswer , of course.\\nHe hands me a piece of paper , folded many times, and I take it, opening\\nit up.\\nAs soon as the image comes into view , I know it instantly . It’s a print-\\nout of an article—one of many about my parents. My father pushes my\\nmother on the swing in this very spot, the brightest smiles I’ve ever seen on\\ntheir faces.\\nIn the distance, above and barely visible, is me. No more than seven or\\neight, staring down at them from  my window with my chin resting on my\\nhands.\\nI refold the paper and hand it back to him.\\n“I can’t believe you’re here,” I tell him just above a whispe r. “You\\nactually left Colorado.”\\n“It was time,” he says.\\nI suck in a breath, his words hitting me like truck.\\nWhat? I slide off the tire and turn to face him not believing what I just heard.\\nDeep but soft. Clear and strong. He spoke.\\nKaleb spoke.\\nWalking around the tire, he steps toward me. “My home is where you\\nare,” he says quietly .\\nI shake my head , and I’m not sure if I just don’t believe I’m hearing this\\nfinally , or if I can’t believe that I can’t remember why the hell I was angry\\nin the first place. It’ s like everything is washing away , and those words were\\nall I needed to hear .\\nReaching into his back pocket, he pulls out a gray paperback that looks\\nfamiliar .\\n“I found the book.” He hands it to me.\\nI take it, seeing it’s The Sirens of Titan we were reading at the fishing\\ncabin. We mean t to finish when we got back home, but we’d realized we\\nleft it behind accidentally .\\n“After you left, I went to the cabin for a long time and started reading it\\nfrom the beginning.”\\nI listen, loving the sound of his beautiful voice. Velvety and soothing,\\nbut his words still thick. These words are all new to him.\\n“Out loud,” he adds.\\nHe practiced speaking the last six weeks by reading out loud.\\nI wipe the corner of my eye.\\nHe comes in, caressing my face and catching a tear before it falls.\\n“Do you hear yourself better now?” he asks. “Alone?”\\nI smile a little. He found my note. His eyes are still always formidable,\\nbut his tone… It betrays his insecurity . He’s worried I don’t want him\\nanymore.\\n“I think I’m ready to hear both of us now ,” I tell him. “Y ou?”\\nHe nods . “I needed to learn it, too,” he explains. “I needed to hear\\nmyself. I’m sorry…it took so long.”\\nI smile, and he dives in and kisses me. I circle my arms around his\\nwaist, warmth coursing down my body instantly .\\nKaleb…\\nHe kisses slow and then fast, dipping his tongue in and then nibbling\\nand tugging my bottom lip. “I go where you go,” he whispers between\\nkisses.\\n“Will you be happy?” I would love to settle back in Chapel Peak—or better yet, at that cabin\\nsomeday . Albeit  with some renovations and expansions. But I have things\\nto do first. Is he coming into the world with me?\\nHe stops and looks down into my eyes. “I won’ t be happy witho ut you,”\\nhe states. “I know that.”\\nAnd that’s all I need to know . As long as we’re together , we’re home. It\\ndoesn’ t matter where.\\n“I love you,” I tell him.\\nHe touches his nose to mine. “I love you, too.”\\nMy chest shakes, and I try not to sob like an imbecile. It feels so good to\\nhear that, though. Finally .\\nWe kiss and hold each other , and I’m already making plans in my head\\nof how we’ll spend the months until design school starts. “Keep talking,” I\\nbeg.\\nI love his voice.\\nHe chuckles, low and heady . “What should I say?”\\n“Anything.” I smile. “Read to me, I guess?”\\nHe grabs the backs of my thighs and lifts me up, wrapping my legs\\naround his body .\\n“Show me your books,” he murmurs against my mouth.\\n“They’re in my bedroom.”\\nHe catches my lips between his teeth, a promise in his dark tone. “I was\\nhoping they were.”\\nI smile and hug him to me as he carries me into the house.  \\n \\n \\nKaleb\\n \\nFive Y ears Later…\\n \\nI run my thumb  over her lips as she moves on top of me, grinding and\\ntaking me inside her .\\nGod, this girl loves tents. Fucking hell.\\nHer back arches and her hair falls down her spine as she rides me, and I\\nlean back on one hand, holding her hip with my other .\\nFuck, baby . I groan.\\n“Kaleb,” T iernan whimpers.\\nShe digs her nails into my shoul ders and comes in, kissing me, her taste\\nand heat making my fucking head spin. This is the second time in six hours,\\nher climbing on top of me and stirring me awake at the crack of dawn just\\nten minutes ago.\\nHow easily I stir for her , though. My beautiful girl.\\nRocks shuffle and crackle on the beach, and I know someone else is up\\nin the camp. I fist her hair , holding her tight to quiet her .\\nShe slows down, calming her breathing, so we don’t embarrass\\nourselves in front of the others, but she keeps rolling her hips. Softly .\\nSilently . Tonguin g my lips, my goddamn stomach flipping as she drives me\\nfucking crazy .\\n“You feel so good,” she mouths across my lips. “I love you, baby .”\\nMy heart swells. I paw her tit, squeezing it and wanting it in my mouth. But my cock throbs, warms, and I hold my breath as she quickens her\\npace, her hot body fucking me so good.\\nWe come, our breath stuttering  and fighting to keep quiet as her tight\\npussy squeezes around me in wet heat. I spill inside of her, dropping my\\nhead back as I pulse and jerk, going as deep as I can.\\nI gasp for breath. Shit.\\nShe falls into me, and we crash  back to the sleeping bags, droplets of\\nmorning dew dotting the roof of our red tent.\\nOver the years, in all of the tents, cabins, motels, and truck beds we’ve\\nslept in on our hikes and travels, she is always extra horny in tents. I don’t\\nknow why .\\nI kiss her , gripping her hair on the top of her head as I hold her to me.\\n“I never want to let you go,” I breathe out. “Not even to piss.”\\nShe laughs. “Y ou have to,” she says. “It’ s your turn this morning.”\\nI grunt my displeasure at the reminder . I hate making him eat that gross\\nshit.\\nShe rolls off me, and I gaze longingly at her ass for a few more precious\\nmoments before I slip into my jeans and take the small bag she hands me.\\nI leave the tent and rise, stretch ing my arms above my head and taking\\nin a breath of warm July air. The pond and waterfall lay ahead, my dad\\ndown on the rocky beach, working the fishing pole already . I grin. Hunting\\nand fishing was the one thing we really liked doing together . I should’ve\\ndone it with him more growing up.\\nI wash up in the pot of water and rinse my face before drying  off and\\ntaking the bag Tiernan gave me over to the green tent next to us. Unzipping\\nit, I lean down and step in, seeing Noah still passed out on his back with my\\nson tucked in his arm.\\nI stand there, appreciating the view for a moment. Griffin is eighteen\\nmonths, and even though it was hard for Tiernan to finish her degree as a\\nnew mom, she did it. With some help from me. We stayed in Seattle for a\\nyear after she graduated, raising him and road-tripping, but finally now,\\nwe’re home in Chapel Peak.\\nNoah opens his eyes, yawning. “Hey .”\\nI kneel down, rubbing Griff’s hair as he still lies asleep. “Thanks for\\nwatching him,” I whisper . “We needed a night alone.”\\nI try to pull the kid of f him. He needs a diaper change, no doubt. But Noah tightens his arm around him. “No.” He scowls at me. “The\\nlittle fucker and I bonded.”\\nI snort, prying my kid of f him anyway . “Get your own.”\\nI hold my son in my arms as he shifts and yawns. He has sandy blond\\nhair and green eyes, his bare feet half the size of my hand. He’ s incredible.\\nI kiss his cheek s a few times, trying to wake him up. Pulling  out the\\nsippy cup Tiernan gave me, I put it to his lips, his eyes finally opening and\\ndrinking the milk.\\n“What the fuck is that?” Noah asks, staring down at the bag.\\nI pull out the plastic container , opening it up and grabbing the spoon.\\n“Some avocado and tofu shit,” I tell him, scooping up a serving.\\nTiernan is determined he’ll be as much a California kid as a Colorado\\none. She can keep that delusio n, because this kid will be all mine the\\nmoment he tastes barbecue ribs for the first time.\\n“He can’ t eat tofu in Chapel Peak,” Noah tells me. “He’ll get bullied.”\\n“Shut up.”\\nI feed Griff, his pouty , little lips scarfing down the food, and I laugh to\\nmyself. He’ll eat pretty much anything. I guess the longer he doesn’ t know\\nhow awful this tastes compared to just about everything else, the better .\\n“Happy to be home?” Noah asks.\\nI nod, feeding the kid more and more. “Y eah.”\\n“You gonna stay out of trouble?”\\n“Nope,” I reply .\\nNoah chuckles as he lies next to us.\\nDad is in Califo rnia a lot now, Van der Berg Extreme merging with JT\\nRacing about four years ago. Since the owners of JTR preferred to stay at\\ntheir home base in Shelburne Falls, Illinois, it ended up being pretty perfect.\\nDad runs the California branch, and Noah races our bikes  with their\\nengines.\\nTiernan and I moved into the house here, but just until constru ction on\\nour own place—a little lower on the mountain—is finished. Which will take\\nmore than a year , I’m sure.\\nThe only thing other than a house that Tiernan demanded on the new\\nproperty was a place to land a helicopter . There was no way she was letting\\nme stitch up our kid if he got injured. She wanted him airlifted to a hospital\\nwith local anesthesia. I’ll continue customizations, she’ll design homes, décor , and furniture\\nas the weather permits, and we’ll live for the winter and the warmth and our\\nfamily with some adventures on the side.\\nI keep feeding Griffin, but I feel Noah’ s eyes on me, like he has more to\\nsay.\\n“What do you want me to do with her ashes?” he finally asks.\\nHer ashes…\\nI don’t look at him, scraping the container and doling out the rest to the\\nkid.\\nI shrug. “T ake ’em, I guess.”\\nThis is why he’s back. Why my father returned. Why we decid ed to go\\ncamping and be together and remember what we have to be grateful for as a\\nfamily .\\nAnna Leigh is dead. My mother .\\nOur mother .\\nMy throat tightens as Griff looks up at me, his big, emera ld eyes\\nwatching me.\\nI force a smile for him.\\n“It’s surreal,” Noah says quietly . “I think she was really someone very\\ndifferent down deep. If not for the drugs.”\\nWhy would he think that? She wasn’ t on drugs in prison. She was in\\nthere fifteen years total, with some spells on the outside in between, and the\\nonly time she touched base was for money . Theft, robbery , dealing…\\nnegligence with her child. She was a bad person.\\nAnd I do remember . I still have to ride with the windows cracke d in the\\ncar.\\n“Maybe she wanted to be different,” he goes on. “Someone who\\nlaughed with her kids. Played games with us and wanted a man to hold her\\nwith love.”\\nAn image of her on her back as she propped me up on her feet so I\\ncould fly flashes in my head. She smiled. I laughed.\\n“That’ s what everyone wants, isn’ t it?” Noah asks. “T o not be alone?”\\nHe doesn’ t have any memories of her. Only a year younger than me, but\\ntoo young. Cancer crept up in March, and it worked quickly . She died in\\nprison a couple of weeks ago.\\nMaybe he’ s right. If she’d never had that first taste, maybe she would’ve\\nbeen dif ferent. “I just want to remember her as she should’ve been.” His voice falls to a\\nwhisper . “I’m too tired at this point to hate her anymore. When it’s over and\\ndone, maybe all she wants is to not be alone now. To know that we think of\\nher sometimes.”\\nTears fill my eyes, and I don’ t want to fucking do this, but I can’ t stop it.\\nI cough to cover the emotion choking me up, because fucking Noah.\\nGoddamn him.\\nShe’s dead, and I’m wrapped warm every night in a family I love. Why\\nshould I hate her?\\n“Ah, fuck it.” I dry my eyes and gather up the food and sippy cup.\\n“Leave me half of the ashes. I’ll spread them on the mountain.”\\nI don’t look at him as I leave the shit and grab my kid, getting out of the\\ntent before I embarrass myself further .\\nHolding Griff close to me, I draw  in some deep breaths, slowly letting it\\ngo. Fucking Noah.\\nMy dad stands at the edge of the water , and I head over, turning the kid\\naround, so he can see the waterfall. The first time we brought his mom here,\\nshe sat on a beach towel right about here.\\nDad glances over , smiling at Grif f. “I can’ t tell who he looks more like.”\\nI look down at my son. His hair is darker than Tiernan’ s, but much\\nlighter than mine. He has my eyes, though.\\n“As long as he’ s loved, I don’ t care,” I tell him.\\n“That he is.” He reels the line back into the spool. “If you want to have\\na few more, I won’ t balk,” he says. “It’s nice to have a kid running around\\nagain. I can be better with him than I was with you two.”\\nI gaze out at the scene, thinking about my childhood. I never once\\nresented my father , growing up. It never crossed my mind that he wasn’ t\\nstriving to do his best.\\nUntil he had her . Then I resented him for a while.\\nBut I drop my eyes, too happy to care anymore. We were lost and\\nbroken, each in our own way, and she needed us as much as we needed her.\\nWe’d die for her .\\n“We’re not robbing banks or drunks,” I finally reply . “Noah and I turned\\nout okay .”\\nAnd then I turn to him. “You want to have a few more, I wouldn’ t mind\\na sister .” He chuc kles, and I cast a glance at the blue tent, knowing who he has\\ntucked inside, even though she continues to try to conceal what we all know\\nhas been  going on for years now. She’s thirty-seven and has no kids. Maybe\\nshe wants one.\\nHe sighs, reeling in his line and changing the subject. “You got a handle\\non the Robinson order?”\\n“Yeah. Don’t worry.” I shoot my eyes left again, seeing Mirai  exit his\\ntent, see us, and quickly dive into her own, as if we’re all stupid.\\nIt’s amusing, though.\\n“She’ s wearing your shirt,” I tell him. “Better go get it.”\\nHe shoots me a smile. “I will.”\\nTiernan walks out of our tent as he heads off, and I look over my\\nshoulder at her , smiling.\\nShe’s dressed in my favorite brown bikini and waving a swim diaper at\\nme.\\nI head over, letting her take the kid and change him as I dive into the\\ntent to get into my trunks and grab his life jacket.\\nWe get him suited up and carry him into the pond.\\n“Ohhhhhh.” She smiles excitedly at Griffin as he splashes his arms and\\nlegs in the water . “It’s cold, isn’ t it?”\\nWe wade out, holding him and playing, the waterfall grabbing his\\nattention as he coos.\\n“Can you say ‘waterfall’?” she asks him.\\nHis eyes light up, looking at her and talking in baby talk.\\nWe slip behind the falls, water drenching our heads and laughing as he\\nsucks in air , a little shocked.\\nTiernan looks around, both of us taking in the new artwork on the walls.\\n“You scared me so much the last time we were here,” she says.\\nI hold Grif fin by the jacket, letting his arms and legs wade freely .\\n“You scare easily ,” I joke.\\n“I don’ t. You were intense.”\\n“Were?” I ask, feigning insult.\\nShe knows I’m intense where it counts now .\\nWe drift in deeper , spinning the baby around in the water .\\n“I should’ve brought you here then,” I tell her. “Or stayed with you in\\nhere that day .”\\n“What makes you think I wouldn’ t have run?” “Because I made your thighs quiver .”\\nShe snorts. “Y ou didn’ t.”\\n“That wasn’ t you moaning on top of the car that first night we met?”\\n“I told you to stop!”\\n“I’m sorry ,” I say sweetly . “I couldn’ t hear you over the soun d of all\\nyour panting.”\\n“Shut up.”\\nI hold the kid with one hand and pull her in with the other . “Wanna try\\nyour luck again?”\\nHer eyebrows shoot up at my challenge.\\n“I can leave Griffin with Noah for a while again tonight.” I stare down\\ninto her eyes, her body pressing into mine, riling me up again. “And maybe\\nmeet you in here at ten? You can show me how good you are at hating\\neverything I do.”\\nShe bites her bottom lip, lookin g at my mouth, and I still see her that\\nday—backing away from me and nervous, but God, I just wanted to stay\\nhere with her .\\nBut she giggles and twists out of my hold, grabbing our son and moving\\nback toward the falls to exit the tunnel.\\n“It’ll be really dark in here at ten,” she warns.\\nReally dark.\\nI move toward her, looking at her just like I did that day so long ago.\\n“I’ll find you.”\\n“If you can…” she taunts.\\nAnd then she disappears with Griff through the falls, and I smile at all\\nthe nights ahead of us.\\n \\n \\nThe End  \\n \\n \\nThank you for reading Cr edence,  and thank you for your reviews! It’ s\\nappreciated so much.\\n \\nA mystery still remains, though!\\nWhat happened to T iernan’ s underwear?\\n \\nDid she get them back?

This is the second time I’ve called in fifteen minutes,\\nand I’ve been texting without any luck, too. Was he planning on still\\nremembering to be here at two?\\nI end the call and glance up at the clock above the bar, seeing it’s nearly\\nmidnight now. Still two hours before my boyfriend thinks I’m off work and\\nneed to be picked up.\\nAnd here I thought we got a lucky surprise tonight, me getting of f early .\\nShit.\\nI need to get my car running. I can’ t keep relying on him for rides.\\nThe music fills the air around me, customers laughing to my right and\\none of the other bartenders filling the cooler with ice to my left.\\nUnease pricks at the back of my neck. If he’s not answering, then he’s\\neither asleep or out. Both could mean he’ll remember me after it’s too late.\\nHe’s not always unreliable, but this wouldn’ t be the first time, either .\\nThat’ s the problem with making your friend your boyfriend, I guess. He\\nstill thinks he can get away with murder .\\nI grab my shirt and school bag out of the cabinet underneath the taps\\nand slide my phone into my pocket. I pull on a flannel over my tank top,\\nbutton it up, and tuck the front of the hem into my jeans, covering myself.\\nI’ll dress a little sexy for tips, but I’m not about to walk out of here like this.\\n“Where are you going?” Shel asks, peering at me as she draws a beer .\\nI glance over at my boss, her black hair with blonde chunks piled on top\\nof her head and a string of tiny hearts tattooed around her upper arm.\\n“There’ s a midnight showing of Evil Dead  at The Grand Theater ,” I tell\\nher as I close the cabinet and slide the strap of my leather satchel over my\\nhead. “I’ll go kill time and wait for Cole there.” She finishes pouring her beer and looks at me like there are a million\\nthings she wants to say but doesn’ t even know where to start.\\nYeah, yeah, I know .\\nI wish she’d stop looking at me like that. There’ s a good possibility\\nCole won’ t be here at two a.m. considering he’s not answering the phone\\nright now . I know that. He could be three sheets to the wind at some friend’ s\\nhouse.\\nOr he could be at home sleepin g with the alarm set to come get me at\\ntwo and his phone left in anothe r room. It’s not likely , but it’s possible. He’s\\ngot two hours. I’ll give him two hours.\\nBesides, my sister is at work, and no one here can leave to drive me\\nhome. Work is slow tonight, and I got cut early because I’m the only one\\nwithout a child to support.\\nEven though I desperately need the money just the same.\\nI grip the strap of the bag over my chest, feeling like I should be older\\nthan eighteen.\\nWell, nineteen now , almost for getting what today is.\\nI take a deep breath, pushing the worry away for tonight. A lot of people\\nmy age struggle for money , can’t pay bills, and have to bum rides. I know\\nit’s too much to expect that I’d have everything figured out by now, but it’s\\nstill embarrassing. I hate looking helpless.\\nAnd I can’t blame Cole, either . It was my decision to use what was left\\nof my student loan money to help him fix his car. He’s been there for me,\\ntoo. At one time, we were all the other one had.\\nTurning around,  Shel sets the beer on the bar in front of Grady—one of\\nthe regulars—and takes his cash, shooting me another look as she enters the\\nsale into the register. “You don’t have a functioning vehicle,”  she states.\\n“And it’s dark outside. You can’t walk to the theater . Sex slavers are just\\nlooking for hot, teenage girls with blonde hair and shit.”\\nI snort. “Y ou need to stop watching Lifetime Movies .”\\nWe might be an easy distance to some larger towns, and Chicago is only\\na few hours away , but we’re still in the middle of nowhere.\\nI lift up the partition and walk out from behind the bar. “The theater is\\nright around the block,” I tell her. “I’ll make it in ten seconds if I run like\\nI’m being graded.”\\nI pat Grady on the back as I leave, the gray hair of his ponytail swaying\\nas he turns to wink at me. “Bye, kiddo,” he says. “’Night.”\\n“Jordan, wait,” Shel shouts over the jukebox, and I turn my head  to look\\nat her .\\nI watch as she pulls a box out of the cooler along with a single serving\\nbox of wine and pushes them both across the bar at me.\\n“Happy Birthda y,” she says, smirking at me like she knows I probably\\nthink she for got.\\nI break into a smile and lift the small Krispy Kreme box open and see\\nhalf a dozen donuts.\\n“It was all I could pick up in a hurry ,” she explains.\\nHey, it’s cake. Kind of. I’m not complaining.\\nI close the box and lift up the flap of my leather bag, hiding my loot\\ninside, wine and all. I didn’ t expect anyone to get me anything , of course,\\nbut it’s still nice to be remembered. Cam, my sister , will no doubt surprise\\nme with a pretty shirt or a sexy pair of earrings tomorrow when I see her,\\nand my dad will probably call me sometime this week.\\nShel knows how to make me laugh, though. I’m old enough to work in a\\nbar but not old enough to drink. Sneaking me some wine I can enjoy off the\\npremises will be my little adventure tonight.\\n“Thank you,” I say and hop up on the bar , planting a kiss on her cheek.\\n“Be safe,” she tells me.\\nI nod once and spin around, heading out the wooden door and stepping\\nout onto the sidewalk.\\nThe door shuts behind me, the music inside now a dull thrumm ing, and\\nmy chest caves, releasing the breath I didn’ t realize I’d been holding.\\nI love her, but I wish she wouldn’ t worry about me. She looks at me like\\nshe’s my mom and wants to fix everything.\\nI guess I should’ve been so lucky as to have a mom like her .\\nThe welcome fresh air washes  over me, the late-night chill sending\\ngoosebumps up my arms, and the fragrant scent of May flowers wafts\\nthrough my nostrils. I tip my head back, close my eyes, and breathe in a\\nlungful as my long bangs tickle my cheek in the light breeze.\\nHot summer nights are coming.\\nI open my eyes and look left and then right, seeing the sidew alks are\\nempty , but cars still line both sides of the street. The VFA parkin g lot is also\\nfull. Their Bingo night usually turns into a bar scene this late, and it looks\\nlike the old timers are still going strong. Turning left, I pull the rubber band out of my hair, letting the loose curls\\nfall down, and slip the band around my wrist as I start walking.\\nThe night feels good, even though it is still a little crisp out. There’ s too\\nmuch liquor in every crevice in there, seeping up into my nose all night.\\nToo much noise and too many eyes, as well.\\nI pick up the pace, excited to disappear into the dark theater for a while.\\nNormally , I don’t go alone, but when they’re showing an older 80’s flick\\nlike Evil Dead , I have to. Cole  is all about special effects and doesn’ t trust\\nfilms made before 1995.\\nI smile, thinking about his quirk s. He doesn’ t know what he’s missing.\\nThe 80s were fantastic. It’s a whole decade of just good fun. Not everything\\nhad to have a meaning or be deep.\\nIt’s a welcome escape, especially tonight.\\nRounding the corner and making my way up to the ticket booth, I see\\nI’m a few minutes early , which  is great. I hate missing the trailers at the\\nbeginning.\\n“One, please,” I tell the cashier .\\nI fish out the wad of tips from my pocket that I made tonight and dole\\nout the seven-fif ty for the ticket. Not that I have money to spare with rent\\ncoming due and a small pile of bills on Cole’ s and my desk back at our\\napartment that we can’t pay yet, but it’s not like seven bucks will make or\\nbreak me.\\nAnd it’ s my birthday , so…\\nWalking inside, I bypass the concession stand and head for the next set\\nof doub le doors. There’ s only one theater , and surprisingly , this place has\\nsurvived for sixty years even in the wake of the bigger twelve-theater\\ncinema centers built in the surrounding towns. The Grand had to get\\ncreative with midnight showing s of classic movies like tonig ht, but also\\ndress-up events and private parties, too. I don’t get down here much with\\nmy school and work schedule, but it’s a nice, dark place when you want to\\nget lost for a while. Private and quiet.\\nStepping through the doors, I check my phone one more time to see that\\nCole hasn’ t called or texted yet. I turn my ringer off and slide it back into\\nmy pocket.\\nSome ads loop on the screen, but the house lights are still on, and I\\nquickly scan the room, seeing a few loners spread out. There’ s also a couple\\nsitting in the back row to my right, and a small group of guys are in the middle—young by the sound of their inconsiderately loud laughter . Out of\\nabout three hundred seats, two hundred eighty-five are still available, and I\\npretty much have my pick.\\nI walk down five or six rows, finding an empty one and slide in, taking\\na seat midway in. I set down my bag and quietly pull out the purple box of\\nwine, reading the label in the dim light.\\nMerlot. I was hoping it was white wine, but I’m sure Shel needs to get\\nrid of this stuff. We only serve it when there’ s an outdoor even t and don’t\\nwant glass outside.\\nUnscrewing the cap, I sniff the pungent scent, not sensing any of the\\nfancy aromas in the least that sommeliers seem to grasp from wine. No hint\\nof oak with a “bold aroma of sweet cherries” or anything like that. Sliding\\nmy tray in front  of me, I take advantage of the empty row ahead and bend\\nup my knees, fitting my Chucks in between the empty seats on the arm rest.\\nSetting the box down, I slip my phone out of my back pocket, just in\\ncase Cole calls, and plop it on the tray next to the wine.\\nBut instead, it spills off the tray. It falls down between my legs and onto\\nthe floor, and I jerk up my knee s to try to catch it, but they bump the tray\\nand send the open box of wine spilling to the floor .\\nMy mouth falls open, and I gasp. “Shit!” I blurt out in a whisper .\\nWhat the hell?\\nPlanting my feet on the floor again, I push the tray off to the side and\\ndive down to the floor , feeling around for my phone. My finge rs dip in the\\nspilled wine, and I flinch at the mess. Glancing up over the seats, I see the\\ngroup of three guys a few rows down, dead ahead of me and right in line of\\nthe oncoming winefall.\\nI groan. Great.\\nA light layer of sweat cools my forehead, and I stand up, yanking my\\nscarf out of my bag to dry off my fingers. I hate to ruin it, but I don’t have\\nany napkins.\\nWhat a mess.\\nSo much for escaping for two hours.\\nI look around for an usher with a light, pretty positive this theater\\ndoesn’ t employ them, especially  at this time of night, but the only flashlight\\nI have is on my phone, and the floors are dark.\\nSeeing no one, I take my scarf and bag and travel up to the next row,\\nbending down and peering unde r the seats to see if I can see my cell. When I find nothing, I move up to the next row and then to the next, pretty sure I\\nheard it slide a ways. Since the rows of seats are on a decline, it could’ve\\ngone far , too. Dammit.\\nMoving up to the next row, I set my stuff down and drop to my hands\\nand knees, peering under the rows to my left and right, feeling with my\\nhands. A pair of long, jean-clad  legs sit ahead, and I look up, seeing a man\\nsitting in the seat with fingers full of popcorn halfway to his mouth. He\\nstares down at me with raised eyebrows.\\n“I’m sorry,” I whisper , tucking my hair behind my ear. “I dropped my\\ndrink and my phone went sliding down here somewhere. Do you mind…?”\\nHe hesitates a moment and then blinks, sitting up. “Yeah, sure.” He\\nmoves his tray aside and stands up, digging something out of his pocket.\\n“Here.”\\nHe turns on the flashlight on his phone and squats down, shining it\\nunder the seats.\\nImmediately , I spot my phone under the seat next to his and snatch it up.\\nThank goodness. We both stand up, and my shoulders relax. I can’t afford a\\nreplacement right now. I smooth  my fingers over the screen, making sure I\\ndon’t feel any cracks.\\n“Got it?” he asks.\\n“Yeah, thank you.”\\nHe kills his flashlight but reaches over, swiping his fingers over the\\nbottom of my phone, and brings them to his nose, smelling.\\n“Is that…” he winces, “wine?”\\nI glance down at the floor , seeing he’s standing in the drink I spilled\\nthree rows up.\\n“Oh, geez.” I look up at him. “I’m so sorry . Is it everywhere?”\\n“No, no, it’s fine.” He lets out a chuckle, his lips curving more to one\\nside with his smile as he steps out of the mess. “I didn’ t realize they sold\\nalcohol here.”\\nI grab my scarf and wipe off my phone. “Oh, they don’t,” I tell him\\nquietly so I don’t disturb others in the theater . “I just got off work. My boss\\ngave it to me for a… um,” I shake my head, searching for words, “to, uh…\\ncelebrate.”\\n“Celebrate?”\\n“Shhh,” someone hisses. We both look to the guy one row back and far to the right who’ s\\nshooting us a glare out of the corner of his eye. Neither the trailers nor\\nmovie have started yet, and we’re not in his line of sight, but I guess we’re\\ndisturbing him. I move away , back toward my bag.\\nThe man helping me picks up his drink and popcorn and follows, the\\nfaint scent of his body wash hitting me. “I’m just going to scooch over, out\\nof the mess,” he says.\\nHe sits a few chairs down and glances up at me and then back to where\\nI was sitting when my phone and wine fell. “You’re welcome to sit.” He\\ngestures to the seat next to him, probably figuring out I’m on my own\\ntonight, too.\\n“Thanks,” I tell him. “I’ll just go…”\\nI don’t finish. I back away and pick up my bag, turning to head to my\\nown seat when I see a guy and girl enter the theater . I freeze, watching them\\nveer left for the back row on the other side of the room and plop down in\\nthe seats.\\nShit.\\nJay McC abe. The only other boyfriend I’ve had other than Cole , and he\\nmakes Cole look like a prince. Unfortunately , he still loves to take a bite out\\nof me any chanc e he gets, and there’ s no way in hell I’m dealin g with him\\ntonight.\\n“You okay?” the guy with the phone light asks when I don’t move. “I\\npromise I’m not making a pass at you. Y ou’re too old for me.”\\nI shoot him a look, forgetting about Jay and the girl for a moment. Too\\nold for him? What? I take in his more than six feet of height, the outline of\\nmuscles visible through his T-shirt, and his corded right forearm with a full\\nsleeve of tattoos disappearing up his shirt. I’ve seen plenty of guys in the\\nbar, and he doesn’ t look like any nineteen year old I’ve ever seen. He’s got\\nto be at least what? Thirty?\\nHe snorts. “I’m kidding,” he says, his mouth spreading in a wide smile\\nthat makes my face fall a little. “If you don’t want to watch the movie\\nalone, you’re welcome to sit. That’ s all I meant.”\\nI dart my gaze to Jay and whom ever he’s with, but then a group of guys\\nsuddenly push through the double doors, making a lot of noise as they enter\\nthe theater . I see Jay look away from the girl and toward the commotion,\\nand I drop down in the seat next to the guy on instinct, not wanting Jay to\\nsee me. “Thanks,” I tell the guy next to me.\\nI feel my ex’s presence in the theater , and the old memories surface,\\nreminding me of how helpless I let him make me feel at one time. I just\\nwant one night where I’m not thinking about everything.\\nI sit back and try to relax, but then I peer out of the corner of my eye,\\nthe close proximity of a guy I don’t know sitting next to me suddenly like a\\nblazing bonfire and impossible to ignore.\\nI turn my head , eyeing him with apprehension. “You’re not a serial\\nkiller , are you?”\\nHe pinches his eyebrows and looks at me. “Are you?”\\n“They’re usually anti-social, Caucasian men.”\\nGood-looking male here all alone? Hmmm…\\nHe arches a sharp brow . “And they look just like everyone else,” he\\nadds, suspicion in his voice as he looks me up and down.\\nThe light from the ads on the screen play in his eyes, neith er of us\\nflinch, but I can’ t take it anymore. I break into a quiet chuckle.\\nI finally hold out my hand to him. “I’m Jordan. Sorry about the wine.”\\n“Jordan?” he repeats, taking my hand and shaking it. “Unusual name for\\na girl.”\\n“No, not really .” I relax into the seat and fold my arms over my chest,\\nlifting my knees  and planting my shoes into the crevice betw een the two\\nempty seats ahead of me. “It was the name of Tom Cruise’ s love interest in\\nCocktail , remember?”\\nHis eyebrows raise in question.\\n“Cocktail?” I repeat. “1988 movie about flair bartending?”\\n“Oh, right.” But he has this unsu re look in his eyes, and I’m not sure he\\nknows what the hell I’m talking about.\\n“Do you like 80’s movies?” I ask, gesturing to the film that we’re about\\nto watch on the screen.\\n“I like scary  movies,” he clarifies and holds the popcorn over to me.\\n“This one’ s a classic. Y ou?”\\n“I love the 80s.” I take a small handful and put a piece in my mouth.\\n“My boyfriend hates my taste in movies and music, but I can’t resist. I’m\\nhere whenever they show something from the decade.”\\nI feel awkward slipping in a random mention of a boyfriend, but I don’t\\nwant to give the wrong impression here. I quickly glance down at his left hand, thankfully not seeing a wedding ring. It would be wrong to sit here\\nwith a married guy .\\nBut he just looks at me knowi ngly. “Breakfast Club  is your favorite,\\nright?” he says. “And every other John Hughes creation?”\\n“You have something against The Br eakfast Club ?”\\n“Not the first ten times I saw it, no.”\\nA smile pulls at my lips. It is on TV a lot, I guess.\\nHe leans in. “The 80s was the age of the action hero,” he points  out, his\\ndeep voice close and hushed. “People forget that. Lethal Weapon, Die Hard,\\nThe T erminator , Rambo …”\\n“Jean-Claude V an Damme,” I add.\\n“Exactly .”\\nI bite the corner of my mouth, so I don’t laugh, but my stomach shakes\\nanyway , and I let out a snort.\\nHe frowns. “What are you laughing at?”\\n“Nothing,” I reply quickly , nodding. “Van Damme. Great actor . Very\\nrelevant films.”\\nI can’t keep the laughter off my face, though, and he furrows his brow\\nknowing I’m full of shit.\\nJust then I hear a giggle somewhere behind me, and I turn my head over\\nmy shou lder, seeing Jay turned away from the screen and leaning into the\\ngirl, both of them full-on making out now .\\n“You know them?” the man next to me asks.\\nI shake my head. He doesn’ t need to know my business.\\nWe fall silent, and I finish the popcorn in my hand, letting my head fall\\nback as I look up to the high ceiling and the antique gold arche s overhead.\\nHe sits next to me, and I breath e in and out slowly , despite the hammering\\nin my chest.\\nWhy am I nervous? Is it Jay?\\nNo, I’m not even thinking about him at the moment.\\nPeople chat around us, waiting for the movie to start, but I can’t hear\\nwhat they’re saying, and I don’ t really care. My skin feels warm.\\n“So, what are you studying at Doral State?” he asks.\\nI shoot him a surprised look. How does he know where I go to school?\\nSerial killer .\\nBut then he gestures to my bag on the floor , and I see the keychain\\nhanging of f it with the university emblem emblazoned on the face. Oh, duh.\\nI sit up. “Landsc ape Design,” I tell him. “I want to make outside spaces\\npretty .”\\n“That’ s nice. I work in construction.”\\nI flash him a half-smile. “So, you make inside spaces pretty then.”\\n“No, not really .”\\nI laugh at his forlorn tone like he’ s so bored with what he does.\\n“I make them functional ,” he corrects me.\\nHe turns hazel eyes on me, warm and piercing, but then his gaze drops\\nto my mouth for a split moment, and a flutter hits my stomach.  He quickly\\nlooks away , and I drop my eyes, having a hard time catching my breath.\\nClearing my throat, I bend down and pull out the box of donuts from my\\nbag and place them on the tray, swinging the little table in front of me and\\nlifting the lid.\\nThe sweet scent immediately hits my nose, and my stomach growls.\\nI glance back at the projection window , wondering if the movie is\\nstarting soon, because I was saving these for that, but now I’m starving.\\nI feel the guy’s eyes on me, and I glance at him, explaining the donuts,\\n“It’s my birthday . In addition to the wine, my boss gave me the only cake\\nshe could get at a drive-thru.”\\nI pick one up and lean back, putting my feet back on the arm rest in\\nfront of me.\\n“You’re going to eat all six donuts?” he questions.\\nI stop the pastry  two inches from my mouth and glare at him. “Would\\nthat disgust you or something?”\\n“No, I’m just wondering if I get one.”\\nI smile and wave at the box, telling him to help himself.\\nHe picks up the plain glazed, and I’m not sure if he’s the no-fr ills type\\nor just trying to save the special sprinkle ones for me, but either way, I kind\\nof like it. We sit back and eat, but I can’t help stealing glances at him every\\nonce in a while.\\nHis brown hair is light, and his eyes look blue, green, or hazel\\ndepending on what kind of light is flashing across them from the screen. He\\nhas a little stubble on his oval-shaped face, a sharp nose, and my gaze is\\ndrawn to the way his angular jaw flexes as he chews. There’ s the faintest of\\nlines around his eyes, so he might be more than thirty , but it could just be\\nall his time working in the sun, too. He’s tall, strong, fit, and tan, and his eyes suddenly flash to the side as if he senses me staring. I turn my eyes\\nforward again.\\nDammit .\\nThat’ s okay , right? It’s normal to find other people attractive. It\\nhappens. I mean, Scarlett Johan sson is attractive. That doesn’ t mean I’m\\ninterested in her .\\nI take another nibble of my donut, my gaze darting to the side again,\\ntaking in his arms and the various tattoos. Black gears and bolts, like a\\nrobot skeleton, some tribal work that definitely says he was a 90’s kid, and I\\ncan just make out what I think is a pocket watch that looks like it’s trying to\\nbreak free of his skin. It’s like a hodgepodge without any discerning theme,\\nbut it’ s beautiful work. I wonder what the story is behind them.\\nI take another bite, the pink glaze and rainbow sprinkles sending electric\\nshocks to the back of my jaw and making me crave the whole damn thing in\\nmy mouth at once.\\n“You know , I really kind of want abs,” I say, chewing, “but these are\\nreally good.”\\nHe breaks into a laugh, looking at me and chuckling.\\n“What?”\\n“Nothing. You’re just…” He looks away as if searching for words.\\n“You’re just kind of, like, intere sting or…something?” He shakes his head.\\n“I’m sorry, I don’t know what I mean.” And then he blurts out, “Cute,” as if\\njust remembering. “Y ou’re cute, I mean.”\\nMy stomach flips, and heat warms my cheeks like I’m in fifth grade\\nagain when it was such a comp liment for a guy you like to tell you you’re\\ncute. I know he means my personality and not how I look, but I kind of like\\nit.\\nHe finishes the donut and takes a sip of his soda. “So, what are you?” he\\nasks. “Like twenty-three, twenty-four?”\\n“Sure, eventually .”\\nHe breathes out a laugh.\\n“Nineteen,” I finally answer .\\nHe takes a deep breath and sighs, something far of f in his gaze.\\n“What?” I take the last bite and brush my hands together , slouching and\\nleaning my head back on the chair .\\n“To be that young again,” he muses. “Seems like yesterday .” Well, how old could he be? Nineteen couldn’ t have been that long ago\\nfor him. T en years? Maybe twelve?\\n“So, you’d do some things dif ferently if you could go back?” I inquire.\\nHe quirks a tight smile and looks down at me, his eyes serious. “Let me\\ntell you something…. A little advice, okay?\\nI listen, looking up at him and my gaze locked with his.\\n“Hit the ground running,” he tells me.\\nHuh?\\nHe must see the confusion on my face, because he goes on.\\n“Time passes by you like a bullet,” he says, “and fear gives you the\\nexcuses you’re craving to not do the things you know you should. Don’ t\\ndoubt yourself, don’t second-gu ess, don’t let fear hold you back, don’t be\\nlazy, and don’t base your decisi ons on how happy it will make others. Just\\ngo for it, okay?”\\nI stare up at him, and unfortunately , that’s all I can seem to do. I want to\\nsmile, because my heart is swelling, and it feels good, but I’m also filled\\nwith something I can’t place. It’s like a dozen different emotions  flooding in\\nat once, and all I can manage are short, shallow breaths.\\n“Okay ,” I whisper to him.\\nI’m not sure if what he said was what I wanted to hear or needed to\\nhear, but I feel my shoulders square a bit more and my chin rise with\\nreadiness. For however long it lasts, I’m a little braver , and he’s my new\\nhero.\\nI watch as he pulls out a small box and proceeds to light a match, the\\nsmall flame burning bright. He sticks it in one of the donuts, all the pink\\nfrosting Shel asked for, because  she knows it’s my favorite color , glowing\\nin the light. I feel my heart warm at the gesture.\\nTaking my feet down, I lean forward, close my eyes, and ask for what I\\nwant in my head, and then I blow out the flame.\\nI didn’t wish for what I usually wish for, though. My mind is suddenly\\nblank, and I’m not rememberin g all the things I need and want right now\\noutside of this theater . Just the only thing I can think of.\\nWe both sit back and settle in, each having another donut as the lights\\nfinally dim, and the surround sound hits us from both sides of the theater .\\nOver the next ninety minutes, we eat and laugh, and I hide my face a\\ncouple times when I know something’ s coming. I jerk here and there and\\nlaugh at him when he does, too, because he looks embarrassed. After a while, I notice my head lays inclined toward him, and he has his foot up on\\nthe empty chair ahead of us with his head laid back, as well, and we’re\\ncompletely comfortable. It hasn’t even occurred to me to keep a certain\\ndistance.\\nI don’t watch a lot of movies with other people. I’m not used to just\\nsitting in silence with someone else. Cole’ s and my schedules don’t always\\nmesh, my sister , Cam, doesn’ t have any free time anymore, and most of my\\nhigh school friendships didn’ t last past graduation about a year ago. It’ s nice\\nto hang out.\\nBy the time the credits roll, I’m not sure I remember much of the movie.\\nBut I haven’ t been this relaxed in a long time. I laughed and smiled and\\njoked around and forgot everything that’s going on out there, and I needed\\nthat. I don’ t really want to go home yet.\\nThe lights start to come up, and I slowly sit up, bringing my feet back to\\nthe floor as I swallow the lump in my throat and glance over at him. He sits\\nup, too, but he barely meets my eyes.\\nStanding up, I hook the strap of the bag over my head and pick up my\\ngarbage.\\n“Well, they’re showing Polter geist  in a few weeks,” he says behind me,\\nrising and taking his trash with him. “If I see you, I’ll make sure to sit at\\nhigher ground.”\\nI laugh under my breath, thinking about the wine. We both exit the row\\nand walk for the doors, and I notice Jay and his date aren’ t in their seats\\nanymore. They must’ve left already, but truth be told, I forgot they were\\nhere a long time ago.\\nPolter geist . Does that mean he’ll be here then? Is this his way of\\nnonchalantly letting me know in case I just happen to want to come, too?\\nBut no, he knows I have a boyfriend.\\nI can’t help but think, though, if for some reason Cole and I didn’ t make\\nit another month, would I come to the movies then, knowing he’d be here?\\nI blink long and hard, guilt washing over me as I trail up the aisle. I’d\\nprobably be here. There aren’ t a lot of “catches” in this town, and I had fun\\ntonight. This guy is interesting.\\nAnd good-looking.\\nAnd employed.\\nI should set him up with my older sister . How he’s gone by undetected\\nunder her radar all this time is a mystery to me. We push through the door, the last ones out of the theater and stop in the\\nlobby , tossing away all our trash.\\nI look up at him, my heart skipp ing a beat at seeing him in the brighter\\nlight and standing tall in front of me. Hazel eyes. Definitely hazel. But more\\ngreen around the outside of the irises.\\nHis hair is styled  with minimal product and just long enough to run your\\nfingers through, and I drop my eyes to his smooth, tan neck. I can’t see if\\nthere’ s a tan line under the collar of his T-shirt, though. Is he like that all\\nover? An unbidden image of him hammering and hauling lumber without a\\nshirt on flashes in my mind and I…\\nI close my eyes again, shaking my head. Yeah, whoa, okay .\\n“Um, I better head back,” I tell him, gripping the strap of my bag.\\n“Hopefully my boyfriend is waiting at the bar to pick me up by now .”\\n“Bar?”\\n“Grounders?” I answer , thinking he probably should know the place. It’ s\\none of only three bars in town, although many favor Poor Red’ s or the strip\\nclub over the dive I work at. “I got off a little early tonight—u nexpectedly\\n—but he’s my ride, and I could n’t get a hold of him. He should be there\\nnow, though.”\\nHe push es the door open, holdi ng it for me as I leave the theater , and\\nfollows me out.\\n“Well, I hope you had a good birthday , despite having to work,” he says.\\nI move to the right toward where Grounders is, and he veers left.\\n“And thanks for keeping me company .” I tell him. “I hope I didn’t ruin\\nthe movie for you.”\\nHe gazes at me for a moment, his breathing growing heavier as a torn\\nlook crosses his face. Finally , he shakes his head, averting his eyes. “Not at\\nall,” he says.\\nA moment of silence passes, and slowly , we both steer farther apart but\\nneither of us turns our backs on one another .\\nThe silence gets longer , the distance farther , and finally he raises a hand,\\ngiving me a little wave before hooking both hands in his back pockets.\\n“Goodnight,” he says.\\nI just stare at him. Yeah, goodnight.\\nAnd then I turn away , my stomach twisting into a tighter knot.\\nI didn’ t even get his name. It’d be nice to say ‘hi’ if I run into him\\nagain. I don’t have time to dwell, though, because my phone rings, and I slide\\nit out of my pocket, seeing Cole’ s name on the screen.\\nI stop on the sidewalk and answer it. “Hey , you at Grounders?” I ask\\nhim. “I’m almost there.”\\nHe doesn’ t say anything, though, and I pause, calling his name . “Cole?\\nHey, are you there?”\\nNothing.\\n“Cole?” I say louder .\\nBut the line is dead. I go to call him back, but I hear a voice behind me.\\n“Your boyfriend’ s name is Cole?” the man from the theater asks. “Cole\\nLawson?”\\nI turn around to see him slowly walking back toward me.\\n“Yeah,” I say . “You know him?”\\nHe hesit ates for a moment as if coming to terms with something, and\\nthen he holds out his hand, finally introducing himself. “I’m  Pike. Pike\\nLawson.”\\nLawson?\\nHe pauses a moment and then adds, “His father .”\\nMy lungs empty . “What?” I breathe out.\\nHis father?\\nMy mouth falls open, but I clamp it shut again, looking up at this man\\nwith new eyes as realization dawns.\\nCole has talked about his father  in passing—I knew he lived in the area\\n—but they’re not close, from what I understand. The impression I had of\\nCole’ s father from his son’ s brief mentions doesn’ t match the guy I talked to\\nin the theater tonight. He’ s nice.\\nAnd easy to talk to.\\nAnd he hardly looks old enoug h to have a nineteen-year -old son, for\\ncrying out loud.\\n“His father?” I say out loud.\\nHe gives me a curt smile, and I know this is a turn of events he wasn’ t\\nexpecting, either .\\nI hear his cell vibrate in his pock et next, and he digs it out, checking the\\nscreen.\\n“And if he’s calling me now, he must be in trouble,” he says, staring at\\nthe phone. “Need a lift?”\\n“A lift where?” “Police station, I’d assume.” He sighs, answering the phone and leading\\nthe way . “Let’ s go.”\\n \\nTo continue reading, click here.  \\n \\n \\nFirst and always, to the readers—When I started publishing in 2013, I\\nfeel like I stuck to a formula. I wanted to please people, they liked what I\\ndid last time, so I went with what worked. And some readers  did like it.\\nAfter all, it’s nice to know what you can rely on with a writer when you’re\\nin the mood for more of whatever you liked from them last time.\\nI quickly realized I wasn’ t happy , though. I wasn’ t growing, and I was\\nbored. So, I dug deep and let my imagination run, building Corrupt  (Devil’ s\\nNight #1) like I built Bully , a parfa it of everything I loved and owning my\\npersonality in the process. Corrupt  ended up rubbing so many readers the\\nwrong way . But…it’ s also many readers’ favorite book, too.\\nThat, I realized, was worth something.\\nI think my biggest fear as a writer is getting into a position where I’m\\nturning out forgettable books like an assembly line every six weeks. I know\\nwith some of you I can be unpredictable, and that’s not necessar ily a virtue.\\nSo thank  you. To those of you who read my stories and come back to read\\nmore. I hope that you always know that whatever I write for you came as a\\nresult of a lot of time and love and dreaming. It was special to me, and I had\\nthe best of intentions. Always.\\nxoxo Pen\\n \\nNow on to the rest…\\nTo my family—my husband and daughter put up with my crazy\\nschedule, my candy wrappers, and my spacing off every time I think of a\\nconversation, plot twist, or scene that just jumped into my head at the dinner table. You both really do put up with a lot, so thank you for your\\npatience.\\nTo Jane Dystel, my agent at Dystel, Goderich & Bourret LLC—there is\\nabsolutely no way I could ever give you up, so you’re stuck with me.\\nTo the PenDragons—you’re my happy place on Facebook. Thanks for\\nbeing the suppor t system I need and always being positive. Espe cially to the\\nhard-working admins: Adrienne Ambrose, Tabitha Russell, Tiffany Rhyne,\\nKristi Grimes, and Lee T enaglia.\\nTo Vibeke Courtney—my indie editor who goes over every move I\\nmake with a fine-toothed comb . Thank you for teaching me how to write\\nand laying it down straight.\\nTo all the wonde rful readers, especially on Instagram, who make art for\\nthe books and keep us all excited, motivated, and inspired…th ank you for\\neverything! I love your vision.\\nTo all of the bloggers and bookstagrammers—there are too many to\\nname, but I know  who you are. I see the posts and the tags, and all the hard\\nwork you do. You spend your free time reading, reviewing, and promoting,\\nand you do it for free. You are the life’s blood of the book world, and who\\nknows what we would do without you. Thank you for your tireless efforts.\\nYou do it out of passion, which makes it all the more incredible.\\nTo T. Gephart, who takes the time to check on me and see if I need a\\nshipment of “real” Aussie T im Tams. (Always!)\\nAnd to B.B. Reid, KD Kimberly Carrillo, and Charleigh Rose for\\nreading, being positive, and being my bouncing board.\\nTo every author and aspiring author—thank you for the stories you’ve\\nshared, many of which have made me a happy reader in search of a\\nwonderful escape and a better writer , trying to live up to your standards.\\nWrite and create , and don’t ever stop.
